# Small-order Hamiltonicity and edge-order representation

Throughout this file, `H` denotes an arbitrary boundary tournament unless another boundary tournament is explicitly named.

Let `K_V` denote the ordinary complete graph on a vertex set `V`. Its edge set consists of the two-element subsets of `V`. The **line graph** `L(K_V)` is the graph with vertex set `E(K_V)` in which two vertices are adjacent exactly when the corresponding ordinary edges meet.

For a boundary tournament `G` on `V`, define the **comparison digraph** `Gamma(G)` as the orientation of `L(K_V)` in which, for distinct `u,v,w`,

`{u,v} -> {v,w}`

if and only if `(u,v,w)` is tight.

An **edge order** on `K_V` is a strict total order `<` on `E(K_V)`. An **edge-ordered complete graph** is a complete graph together with such an edge order. A vertex-simple sequence `(v_0,...,v_k)` is an **increasing path** if

`{v_0,v_1} < {v_1,v_2} < ... < {v_{k-1},v_k}`.

## 1. Comparison representation

For every boundary tournament `G`:

1. `Gamma(G)` is a well-defined orientation of `L(K_V)`.
2. A vertex-simple sequence is a tight path in `G` if and only if its consecutive ordinary edges form a directed chain in `Gamma(G)`.
3. There exists an edge order `<` satisfying
   
   `(u,v,w) is tight  iff  {u,v}<{v,w}`
   
   for all distinct `u,v,w` if and only if `Gamma(G)` is acyclic.
4. If `Gamma(G)` is cyclic and `C` is a shortest directed cycle, then `C` is chordless in `L(K_V)`. Its underlying ordinary edges are either a three-edge star, the three edges of an ordinary triangle, or the edges of a vertex-simple ordinary cycle of length at least four.

**Proof.** If `{u,v}` and `{v,w}` are incident ordinary edges, the two possible comparison directions correspond to the reversal pair `(u,v,w)` and `(w,v,u)`. Boundary antisymmetry chooses exactly one, proving the first assertion.

For a vertex-simple sequence `P=(v_0,...,v_k)`, put `e_i={v_{i-1},v_i}`. By definition, `e_i->e_{i+1}` is equivalent to tightness of `(v_{i-1},v_i,v_{i+1})`. This proves the second assertion.

If an edge order realizes all tight triples, every comparison arc points from a smaller edge to a larger edge, so `Gamma(G)` is acyclic. Conversely, if `Gamma(G)` is acyclic, it has a vertex of indegree zero: otherwise, following incoming arcs indefinitely would repeat a vertex and create a directed cycle. Repeatedly remove such a vertex to obtain a topological ordering of all vertices. In that total order, each adjacent pair of vertices of `Gamma(G)` appears in the direction of its comparison arc, so the order realizes every tight triple. This proves the third assertion.

Now let

`e_0 -> e_1 -> ... -> e_{m-1} -> e_0`

be a shortest directed cycle. A chord between nonconsecutive cycle vertices, in either direction, combines with one of the two directed segments of the cycle to give a shorter directed cycle. Hence the cycle is chordless.

For `m=3`, three pairwise incident ordinary edges are either the three edges of one triangle or three edges through one common vertex. For `m>=4`, chordlessness implies that nonconsecutive ordinary edges are disjoint and consecutive ones meet. Writing `v_i=e_{i-1}∩e_i` cyclically, the vertices `v_i` are distinct and `e_i={v_i,v_{i+1}}`. Thus the ordinary edges form a vertex-simple cycle. ∎

An **ordinary tournament** on a set `S` is an orientation of the complete graph on `S`. It is **transitive** if its vertices can be linearly ordered so that every arc points forward.

## 2. Three common-endpoint triples force a Hamilton five-path

Let `a,c,p,q,r` be distinct vertices of `H`. If

`(a,p,c)`, `(a,q,c)`, `(a,r,c)`

are tight, then `H[{a,c,p,q,r}]` has a Hamilton tight path.

**Proof.** For distinct `x,y∈{p,q,r}`, define tournaments

`x ->_a y` iff `(x,a,y)` is tight,

`x ->_c y` iff `(x,c,y)` is tight.

If distinct `x,y,z` satisfy `x->_a y->_c z`, then `(x,a,y,c,z)` is a Hamilton tight path. Assume no such mixed chain exists.

The tournament `->_a` cannot be transitive. Otherwise relabel so `x->_a y->_a z` and `x->_a z`. Excluding `(x,a,y,c,z)` forces `z->_c y`, while excluding `(x,a,z,c,y)` forces `y->_c z`, impossible. Hence, after relabelling,

`p->_a q->_a r->_a p`.

Excluding the three mixed chains forces

`r->_c q`, `p->_c r`, `q->_c p`.

Assume still that no Hamilton five-path exists. In each of the following six words the first two consecutive triples are tight, so the third must be non-tight and its reverse must be tight:

| word | forced tight triple |
| --- | --- |
| `a p c r q` | `(q,r,c)` |
| `a q c p r` | `(r,p,c)` |
| `a r c q p` | `(p,q,c)` |
| `p q a r c` | `(a,q,p)` |
| `q r a p c` | `(a,r,q)` |
| `r p a q c` | `(a,p,r)` |

Using these six triples and the same argument gives:

| word | forced tight triple |
| --- | --- |
| `a p r c q` | `(c,r,p)` |
| `a q p c r` | `(c,p,q)` |
| `a r q c p` | `(c,q,r)` |
| `p a q r c` | `(r,q,a)` |
| `q a r p c` | `(p,r,a)` |
| `r a p q c` | `(q,p,a)` |

Set

`u=1` iff `(q,p,r)` is tight,
`v=1` iff `(p,q,r)` is tight,
`w=1` iff `(p,r,q)` is tight.

For each of the eight values of `(u,v,w)`, every consecutive triple of each candidate below is already determined except the displayed reversal pair:

| `(u,v,w)` | first candidate | second candidate | remaining reversal pair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `000` | `a c q r p` | `r p q c a` | `(a,c,q)` / `(q,c,a)` |
| `100` | `c a r q p` | `q p r a c` | `(c,a,r)` / `(r,a,c)` |
| `010` | `a c p q r` | `q r p c a` | `(a,c,p)` / `(p,c,a)` |
| `110` | `a c p q r` | `q r p c a` | `(a,c,p)` / `(p,c,a)` |
| `001` | `c a p r q` | `r q p a c` | `(c,a,p)` / `(p,a,c)` |
| `101` | `c a p r q` | `r q p a c` | `(c,a,p)` / `(p,a,c)` |
| `011` | `a c r p q` | `p q r c a` | `(a,c,r)` / `(r,c,a)` |
| `111` | `c a q p r` | `p r q a c` | `(c,a,q)` / `(q,a,c)` |

Boundary antisymmetry makes exactly one member of the remaining reversal pair tight. Hence one candidate in each row is a Hamilton tight path, a contradiction. ∎

## 3. Non-Hamiltonian five-sets are edge-orderable

Let `G` be a boundary tournament on exactly five vertices. If `G` has no Hamilton tight path, then `Gamma(G)` is acyclic. Equivalently, there is a strict total order `<` on `E(K_5)` such that, for all distinct `u,v,w`,

`(u,v,w) is tight  iff  {u,v}<{v,w}`.

**Proof.** Suppose `G` is non-Hamiltonian and `Gamma(G)` contains a directed cycle. Choose a shortest one. By Section 1 it is a star triangle, an ordinary triangle, or a vertex-simple ordinary cycle. A comparison cycle of length five itself gives a Hamilton tight path, so an ordinary cycle can only have length four.

In the case tables below, a three-letter string such as `xyz` abbreviates the assertion that `(x,y,z)` is tight. We repeatedly use the following forcing rule. Let `W=v_0v_1v_2v_3v_4` be a word on all five vertices. If two of its three consecutive triples are known to be tight, then the third cannot also be tight, because otherwise `W` is a Hamilton path. Hence the reverse of the third triple is tight. We write `W => xyz` when this rule forces the triple `(x,y,z)`.

**Ordinary four-cycle.** Normalize the comparison cycle as

`oa -> ab -> bc -> co -> oa`,

so `(o,a,b),(a,b,c),(b,c,o),(c,o,a)` are tight, and let `d` be the fifth vertex. The following complementary branches are exhaustive; each row is read from left to right.

| branch | successive forced triples | contradiction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `acd, oac` | `bcoad=>dao; boacd=>aob; daobc=>cbo; cdaob=>adc; adcbo=>bcd; oabcd=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |
| `acd, cao` | `dbcoa=>cbd; doabc=>aod; caodb=>bdo; acbdo=>bca; bcaod=>doa; doabc=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |
| `dca, bac` | `coabd=>dba; odbac=>bdo; abcod=>doc; bdoca=>aco; dbaco=>abd; coabd=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |
| `dca, cab` | `dcabo=>oba; dabco=>bad; obadc=>cda; cobad=>boc; bocda=>dco; dcoab=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |

Thus a shortest comparison cycle is not an ordinary four-cycle.

**Star triangle.** Normalize the star triangle at `o` so that

`(a,o,b)`, `(b,o,c)`, `(c,o,a)`

are tight. For the fifth vertex `d`, set

`S(d)={u in {a,b,c} : (u,o,d) is tight}`.

Cyclic permutation of `a,b,c` preserves the normalized star triangle. Also define the reverse boundary tournament `G^rev` by declaring `(x,y,z)` tight in `G^rev` exactly when `(z,y,x)` is tight in `G`. Reversing the vertex order of a tight path in `G` gives a tight path in `G^rev`. Passing to `G^rev` and then exchanging the labels `b,c` restores the normalized star triangle and sends `|S(d)|` to `3-|S(d)|`. Hence it is enough to treat `|S(d)|=0` and `|S(d)|=1`.

If `|S(d)|=0`, then `(d,o,a),(d,o,b),(d,o,c)` are tight. The following branches are exhaustive:

| branch | successive forced triples | contradiction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `obc` | `dobca=>acb; doacb=>cao; dcaob=>acd; aobcd=>dcb; daobc=>oad; oadcb=>cda; bocda=>dco; bdcoa=>cdb; acdbo=>obd; caobd=>oac` | `oac` and `cao` |
| `cbo, oda, oba, bdc` | `bdcoa=>ocd; bocda=>adc; obadc=>dab; odabc=>cba; docba=>bco; dbcoa=>cbd; aobdc=>dbo; adboc=>bda; cbdao=>oad; bcoad=>dao` | `oda` and `dao` |
| `cbo, oda, oba, cdb` | `dobac=>cab; cdoba=>odc; odcab=>acd; acdbo=>obd; caobd=>oac; oacdb=>cao` | `oac` and `cao` |
| `cbo, oda, abo, oac` | `abocd=>dco; daboc=>bad; badco=>cda; cdaob=>oad; coadb=>bda; bcoad=>ocb; ocbda=>dbc; doacb=>bca; odbca=>bdo; bdoac=>cao` | `oac` and `cao` |
| `cbo, oda, abo, cao` | `dcaob=>acd; abocd=>dco; bdcoa=>cdb; acdbo=>obd; caobd=>oac` | `oac` and `cao` |
| `cbo, ado, obd` | `caobd=>oac; badoc=>dab; daboc=>oba; dobac=>cab; cdoba=>odc; odcab=>acd; aobdc=>cdb; oacdb=>cao` | `oac` and `cao` |
| `cbo, ado, dbo` | `adboc=>bda; cadob=>dac; bdaco=>oca; dboca=>obd` | `obd` and `dbo` |

If `|S(d)|=1`, cyclically relabel so `S(d)={c}`. Thus `(d,o,a),(d,o,b),(c,o,d)` are tight. The exhaustive branches are:

| branch | successive forced triples | contradiction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `odb, adc` | `codba=>abd; acodb=>oca; ocabd=>bac; dobac=>abo; abocd=>dco; badco=>dab; daboc=>oba` | `oba` and `abo` |
| `odb, cda` | `cdaob=>oad; acodb=>oca; bocad=>dac; dboca=>obd; obdac=>adb; coadb=>dao` | `oad` and `dao` |
| `bdo, bdc` | `bdcoa=>ocd; abocd=>oba; aobdc=>dbo; dboca=>aco; adboc=>bda; bdaco=>cad; cadob=>oda; codab=>bad; bocda=>adc; obadc=>abo` | `oba` and `abo` |
| `bdo, cdb` | `bdoac=>cao; dcaob=>acd; acdbo=>obd; caobd=>oac` | `oac` and `cao` |

The symmetry already described handles `|S(d)|=2,3`. Thus a shortest comparison cycle is not a star triangle.

**Ordinary triangle.** Normalize the comparison triangle as

`oa -> ab -> bo -> oa`,

so `(o,a,b),(a,b,o),(b,o,a)` are tight, and let `c,d` be the other vertices. For `w∈{c,d}` define

`o in M(w)` iff `(b,w,a)` is tight,

`a in M(w)` iff `(o,w,b)` is tight,

`b in M(w)` iff `(a,w,o)` is tight.

If `M(c)` and `M(d)` shared a coordinate, that coordinate, together with `c,d`, would be the three middle vertices of three tight triples with the same first and third vertices; Section 2 would give a Hamilton five-path. Hence `M(c)` and `M(d)` are disjoint.

Up to cyclic permutation of `o,a,b` and exchange of `c,d`, the disjoint pair is one of

`(∅,∅)`, `(∅,{o})`, `(∅,{o,a})`, `(∅,{o,a,b})`, `({o},{a})`, `({o},{a,b})`.

The match-set definition fixes all mixed triples involving one exterior vertex and two vertices of the fixed three-set used in the following exhaustive table:

| `M(c),M(d)` | extra branch | successive forced triples | contradiction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `∅,∅` | none | `bcoda=>doc; bdoca=>aco` | `oca` and `aco` |
| `∅,{o}` | none | `bcoda=>doc; bdoca=>aco` | `oca` and `aco` |
| `∅,{o,a}` | none | `bcoda=>doc; docab=>bac; odbac=>abd; odacb=>cad; bocad=>cob; cobda=>dbo; cdboa=>bdc; oabdc=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |
| `∅,{o,a,b}` | `abc` | `abcod=>doc; badoc=>dab; dabco=>ocb` | `ocb` and `bco` |
| `∅,{o,a,b}` | `cba` | `cbado=>dab; cdabo=>adc; boadc=>dao; cbdao=>dbc; dbcoa=>aoc; bdaoc=>oad` | `oad` and `dao` |
| `({o},{a})` | `ocd` | `bcoda=>doc; docab=>bac; odbac=>abd; oabdc=>cdb; aocdb=>coa; coabd=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |
| `({o},{a})` | `dco` | `ocadb=>dac; bodac=>dob; dobca=>cbo; dcboa=>bcd; cboad=>dao; bcdao=>adc; badco=>dab; daboc=>cob; adcob=>cda; bcdao=>oad` | `oad` and `dao` |
| `({o},{a,b})` | `cod` | `codba=>abd; abcod=>cba; cbado=>dab; daboc=>cob; cdabo=>adc; adcob=>ocd; oabdc=>cdb; aocdb=>coa; coabd=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |
| `({o},{a,b})` | `doc` | `docab=>bac; odbac=>abd; badoc=>dab; daboc=>cob; cdabo=>adc; adcob=>ocd; oabdc=>cdb; aocdb=>coa; coabd=>bao` | `oab` and `bao` |

The extra branches in the table are reversal pairs, so the table is exhaustive. Thus no shortest directed comparison cycle exists. Hence `Gamma(G)` is acyclic, and Section 1 gives the required edge order. ∎

## 4. Edge-ordered four-set structure

### 4.1 Matching-block classification

An edge-ordered `K_4` has no increasing Hamilton path if and only if its three opposite-edge perfect matchings occur as three strict consecutive blocks in the edge order.

**Proof.** Let the six edges be
`e_1<e_2<...<e_6`.
If there is no increasing Hamilton path and `e_1,e_2` meet, say `e_1=ab`, `e_2=bc`, then for the fourth vertex `d` the edge `cd` occurs after `e_2`, so `a,b,c,d` is increasing, a contradiction. Hence `e_1,e_2` are disjoint. Dually `e_5,e_6` are disjoint. Therefore `{e_1,e_2}`, `{e_3,e_4}`, `{e_5,e_6}` are exactly the three opposite perfect matchings.

Conversely, in any Hamilton four-vertex word the first and third ordinary edges are disjoint, hence belong to the same opposite-edge matching. If each matching is a strict block, the middle edge lies wholly before or wholly after that block, so it cannot lie strictly between the first and third edges. Thus no Hamilton word is increasing. ∎

### 4.2 Two non-Hamiltonian four-sets force a Hamilton five-set

Let `K` be an edge-ordered complete graph, let `T={u_0,u_1,u_2}`, and let `x,y` be distinct vertices outside `T`. If neither `K[T∪{x}]` nor `K[T∪{y}]` has an increasing Hamilton path, then `K[T∪{x,y}]` has an increasing Hamilton path.

**Proof.** First classify a non-Hamiltonian edge-ordered `K_4`. Let its six ordinary edges be

`e_1<e_2<...<e_6`.

If `e_1,e_2` met, say `e_1=ab` and `e_2=bc`, then for the fourth vertex `d` the edge `cd` occurs after `e_2`, so `a,b,c,d` is an increasing Hamilton path. Thus `e_1,e_2` are disjoint. Dually `e_5,e_6` are disjoint. Hence the pairs `{e_1,e_2}`, `{e_3,e_4}`, `{e_5,e_6}` are the three opposite perfect matchings of `K_4`, ordered in three strict blocks.

Relabel `T` so

`u_1u_2 < u_0u_2 < u_0u_1`.

For `r∈{x,y}`, the matching-block classification in `T∪{r}` forces

`ru_0 < ru_1 < ru_2`.

If `xu_1<yu_1`, then

`u_0,x,u_1,y,u_2`

is increasing. If `yu_1<xu_1`, then

`u_0,y,u_1,x,u_2`

is increasing. ∎

## 5. Extending a fixed three-vertex path

Let `P` be a tight path of `H` on three vertices and let `x,y,z` be distinct vertices of `V(H)-V(P)`. At least one of

`V(P)∪{x,y}`, `V(P)∪{x,z}`, `V(P)∪{y,z}`

has a Hamilton tight path.

**Proof.** Write `P` on vertices `{a,b,c}`. Assume, for contradiction, that all three five-sets obtained by adding two of `x,y,z` are non-Hamiltonian. Section 3 shows that each is represented by an edge order. Their restrictions to the common triangle `{a,b,c}` realize the same comparison orientation, so after relabelling the three vertices we may assume

`ab<ac<bc`.

Thus `(b,a,c)`, `(a,b,c)`, `(a,c,b)` are tight.

For an exterior vertex `w`, define

`a in M(w)` iff `(b,w,c)` is tight,

`b in M(w)` iff `(a,w,c)` is tight,

`c in M(w)` iff `(a,w,b)` is tight.

In an edge order on a five-set containing `{a,b,c,w}`, the relative order of `wa,wb,wc` gives exactly the following six possibilities:

| order of `wa,wb,wc` | `M(w)` |
| --- | --- |
| `wa<wb<wc` | `{a,b,c}` |
| `wa<wc<wb` | `{b,c}` |
| `wb<wa<wc` | `{a,b}` |
| `wb<wc<wa` | `{a}` |
| `wc<wa<wb` | `{c}` |
| `wc<wb<wa` | `∅` |

If two exterior vertices `u,v` shared a coordinate of their match sets, Section 2 would apply. Indeed, a shared coordinate `a` gives the triples `(b,a,c),(b,u,c),(b,v,c)`; a shared coordinate `b` gives `(a,b,c),(a,u,c),(a,v,c)`; and a shared coordinate `c` gives `(a,c,b),(a,u,b),(a,v,b)`. In every case `P∪{u,v}` would have a Hamilton five-path, a contradiction. Hence `M(x),M(y),M(z)` are pairwise disjoint.

Two match sets cannot both be `∅`. If `M(u)=M(v)=∅`, then in the edge order on `P∪{u,v}`,

`uc<ub<ua`, `vc<vb<va`.

If `ub<vb`, the word `c,u,b,v,a` is increasing; if `vb<ub`, the word `c,v,b,u,a` is increasing. Either contradicts non-Hamiltonicity.

Therefore exactly one match set is `∅`. The other two are disjoint nonempty members of

`{a}`, `{c}`, `{a,b}`, `{b,c}`, `{a,b,c}`.

Three nonempty pairwise disjoint match sets would have to be `{a},{b},{c}`, but `{b}` is not in the list. After naming the vertex `x` with empty match set and ordering `y,z`, only the following three cases remain:

`I. M(x)=∅, M(y)={a}, M(z)={c};`

`II. M(x)=∅, M(y)={a}, M(z)={b,c};`

`III. M(x)=∅, M(y)={a,b}, M(z)={c}.`

Assume throughout that the relevant five-set is non-Hamiltonian. We use the same forcing rule: if a five-vertex word has two known tight triples, the reverse of its third triple is forced. The initial mixed triples involving one exterior vertex and two vertices of the fixed three-set are

`I: cxb,cxa,bxa; byc,cya,bya; czb,cza,azb.`

`II: cxb,cxa,bxa; byc,cya,bya; czb,azc,azb.`

`III: cxb,cxa,bxa; byc,ayc,bya; czb,cza,azb.`

The following table completes the three cases:

| case | successive forced triples | contradiction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | `bycxa=>xcy; xcyab=>bay; cxbay=>abx; czbxa=>xbz; acxbz=>xca; xcazb=>zac; yzacb=>azy; cxbya=>ybx; ybxac=>cax; bycax=>acy; bacyz=>zyc; bazyc=>zab; czabx=>xba` | `abx` and `xba` |
| II | `cxbya=>ybx; ybxac=>cax; bycax=>acy; bacyz=>zyc; czbxa=>xbz; acxbz=>xca; xcazb=>zac; zacbx=>xbc; xbcya=>ycb; azycb=>yza; yzacb=>bca` | `acb` and `bca` |
| III | `cxbya=>ybx; ybxac=>cax; bycax=>acy; xbacy=>abx; czbxa=>xbz; acxbz=>xca; xcazb=>zac; yzacb=>azy; bacyz=>zyc; bazyc=>zab; czabx=>xba` | `abx` and `xba` |

Each case violates boundary antisymmetry. ∎

## 6. Four Hamiltonian five-subsets of every six-set

For every six-element set `E⊆V(H)`, at least four of the five-element subsets of `E` induce Hamiltonian boundary tournaments.

**Proof.** Let `E` be a six-set and let

`M={e in E : H[E-{e}] has a Hamilton path}`.

Choose any three-set `T⊆E`. The complementary three-set `P=E-T` can be ordered as a tight path: choose any middle vertex, and boundary antisymmetry chooses one of the two orders of the other two vertices. Section 5 applied to this path and the three vertices of `T` shows that `M∩T` is nonempty. If `|E-M|>=3`, choose `T⊆E-M` of order three, a contradiction. Thus `|M|>=4`. ∎

## 7. Non-Hamiltonian four-subsets of a five-set

Let `S⊆V(H)` have order five. If `H[S]` is Hamiltonian, at most three four-element subsets of `S` are non-Hamiltonian. If `H[S]` is non-Hamiltonian, at most one four-element subset of `S` is non-Hamiltonian.

**Proof.** Let `S` be a five-set. If `H[S]` is Hamiltonian, choose a Hamilton order `(v_0,...,v_4)`. Deleting `v_0` or deleting `v_4` leaves a Hamilton tight four-vertex path, so at most three of the five four-subsets are non-Hamiltonian.

Suppose instead that `H[S]` is non-Hamiltonian. By Section 3 it is represented by an edge order. If two distinct four-subsets were both non-Hamiltonian, they would have the form `T∪{x}` and `T∪{y}` for their three-vertex intersection `T`. Their induced edge orders have no increasing Hamilton path, so Section 4.2 gives an increasing Hamilton path on all five vertices. By the representation, this is a tight Hamilton path of `H[S]`, a contradiction. Thus in the non-Hamiltonian case at most one four-subset is non-Hamiltonian. ∎
