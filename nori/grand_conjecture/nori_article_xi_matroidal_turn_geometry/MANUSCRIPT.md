# Article XI — Matroidal Turn Geometry and Rainbow-Circuit Exchange

## Antipodal turn quotients and rainbow-circuit geometry

Let \(n\ge3\), let \(Q_n\) be the \(n\)-dimensional cube, and let \(L=L(Q_n)\) be its line graph. Thus vertices of \(L\) are edges of \(Q_n\), and the edges of \(L\) are pairs of distinct cube edges meeting at one cube vertex. The antipodal involution \(\tau\) of \(Q_n\) induces a free involution on \(L\). Write
\[
H_n=L/\langle\tau\rangle.
\]
The vertices of \(H_n\) are antipodal pairs \([e]=\{e,\tau e\}\) of cube edges. They are partitioned into \(n\) direction classes \(V_1,\ldots,V_n\), according to the coordinate direction of \(e\). The edges of \(H_n\) are antipodal pairs of incident cube-edge pairs. In particular,
\[
|V(H_n)|=n2^{n-2},\qquad
|E(H_n)|=\binom n2 2^{n-1}.\tag{1}
\]
The natural projection \(p:L\to H_n\) is a connected two-sheeted graph covering.

For a closed walk \(C\) in \(H_n\), let \(\alpha(C)\in\mathbb F_2\) be its covering monodromy: \(\alpha(C)=1\) when a lift that begins at \(e\) ends at \(\tau e\), and \(\alpha(C)=0\) otherwise. This defines a nonzero linear functional on the binary cycle space \(Z_1(H_n;\mathbb F_2)\). Fix any edge cochain \(a\in\mathbb F_2^{E(H_n)}\) whose sum on a closed walk \(C\) equals \(\alpha(C)\).

**Theorem 1 (switching-class representation).** Antipodally odd edge colorings \(c:E(Q_n)\to\mathbb F_2\), satisfying \(c(\tau e)=c(e)+1\), induce turn cochains
\[
d([\{e,f\}])=c(e)+c(f),\tag{2}
\]
where \(e,f\) meet at a vertex of \(Q_n\). The set of resulting cochains is precisely
\[
\boxed{\quad a+B^1(H_n;\mathbb F_2)
=\{a+\delta f:f:V(H_n)\to\mathbb F_2\}.\quad}\tag{3}
\]
Equivalently, a turn cochain \(d\) is admissible if and only if
\[
\boxed{\ \sum_{t\in C}d(t)=\alpha(C)
\quad\text{for every cycle }C\text{ of }H_n.\ }\tag{4}
\]
Each admissible \(d\) determines an antipodally odd coloring up to complementation of all edge colors. The affine space (3) has dimension \(n2^{n-2}-1\).

*Proof.* Choose one representative from each antipodal pair of cube edges. Define a reference coloring \(s\) to be zero on these representatives and one on their antipodes. Its incident-edge differences descend to a cochain \(a_s\) on \(H_n\), because complementation of both incident edges preserves their difference. Given a closed turn walk in \(H_n\), lift its edge sequence in \(L\), starting at a cube edge \(e\) and ending at \(\tau^\varepsilon e\). Telescoping the differences of \(s\) along the lifted sequence gives
\[
\sum_{t\in C}a_s(t)=s(e)+s(\tau^\varepsilon e)=\varepsilon=\alpha(C).
\]
Thus \(a_s\) represents the prescribed class, and \(a+a_s\) has zero sum on every cycle. On a connected graph every such cochain is a coboundary, so \(a=a_s+\delta g\) for some vertex function \(g\).

For any other antipodally odd coloring \(c\), the function \(c(e)+s(e)\) is invariant under \(\tau\), hence equals \(f([e])\) for a vertex function on \(H_n\). Consequently
\[
d=a_s+\delta f.
\]
Conversely, every \(f\) gives an antipodally odd coloring \(c(e)=s(e)+f([e])\) and induces \(a_s+\delta f\). Replacing \(f\) by \(f+1\) complements the coloring and leaves \(d\) unchanged; connectedness gives no other kernel. Formula (4) is the standard cycle-space characterization of the affine cut coset (3). Since the coboundary space of a connected graph with \(N\) vertices has dimension \(N-1\), the last assertion follows. \(\square\)

Let \(B\) be the vertex-edge incidence matrix of \(H_n\) over \(\mathbb F_2\). For an admissible turn cochain \(d\), consider the binary matrix
\[
A_d=\begin{pmatrix}B\\d\end{pmatrix},\tag{5}
\]
whose columns are indexed by turns. The vector matroid represented by (5) is the even-cycle matroid associated with the nontrivial covering class \(\alpha\).

**Corollary 2 (a canonical binary matroid).** Every admissible \(d\) gives the same represented binary matroid \(M_n\). Its rank is
\[
\operatorname{rank}M_n=n2^{n-2}.\tag{6}
\]
A binary edge set \(F\subseteq E(H_n)\) is dependent in \(M_n\) precisely when it contains a nonempty binary cycle \(z\) with \(\alpha(z)=0\). In particular, a simple cycle \(C\) of \(H_n\) is independent in \(M_n\) if \(\alpha(C)=1\), and dependent if \(\alpha(C)=0\).

*Proof.* By (3), \(d=a+\delta f=a+f^TB\), so the last row of \(A_d\) differs from that of \(A_a\) by a linear combination of the preceding rows. All matrices \(A_d\) therefore have the same row space and represent the same matroid. The incidence matrix \(B\) has rank \(N-1\), where \(N=|V(H_n)|\). Since \(\alpha\ne0\), the row \(a\) has a nonzero sum on some cycle and does not lie in the row space of \(B\). Hence \(\operatorname{rank}A_a=N\). Finally, a nonzero binary vector \(z\) belongs to the kernel of \(A_d\) if and only if \(Bz=0\) and \(d z=\alpha(z)=0\), giving the dependence characterization. \(\square\)

Call a simple cycle of \(H_n\) **direction-rainbow** if its \(n\) vertices contain one member of each direction class \(V_i\).

**Theorem 3 (rainbow-circuit dichotomy).** Let \(C\) be a direction-rainbow simple cycle of \(H_n\). Precisely one of the following holds:

1. \(\alpha(C)=0\), and \(C\) is obtained by cyclically ordering the \(n\) cube edges incident with one cube vertex and projecting the corresponding turn cycle to \(H_n\).
2. \(\alpha(C)=1\), and \(C\) is obtained by cyclically completing a full antipodal geodesic of \(Q_n\): consecutive edges of the geodesic give the first \(n-1\) turns, and the final turn joins its last edge to the antipode of its first edge.

Conversely, every cyclically ordered cube-edge star and every full antipodal geodesic gives a direction-rainbow cycle of the indicated type. Therefore
\[
\boxed{\begin{aligned}
\{\text{full antipodal geodesic cycles}\}
=\{\text{direction-rainbow graphic circuits }C:
\alpha(C)=1\}.
\end{aligned}}\tag{7}
\]
By Corollary 2, the cycles in (7) are also precisely those direction-rainbow graphic circuits that are independent in \(M_n\).

*Proof.* Traverse \(C\) as a cyclic sequence of its vertices and lift it to a walk
\[
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n,e_{n+1}
\quad\text{in }L(Q_n),
\qquad e_{n+1}=\tau^\varepsilon e_1,\tag{8}
\]
where \(\varepsilon=\alpha(C)\). Write \(\pi_i\) for the direction of \(e_i\). The direction-rainbow hypothesis says that \(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n\) is a permutation of \(\{1,\ldots,n\}\).

For \(1\le i\le n\), let \(u_i\in Q_n\) be the common cube vertex of the incident edges \(e_i,e_{i+1}\), and define \(u_0=\tau^\varepsilon u_n\). The vertices \(u_{i-1},u_i\) both belong to the cube edge \(e_i\); hence
\[
u_i=u_{i-1}\oplus t_i\,\mathbf e_{\pi_i}
\qquad(t_i\in\mathbb F_2).\tag{9}
\]
Because \(u_n=\tau^\varepsilon u_0\), summing (9) yields
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n t_i\mathbf e_{\pi_i}
=\varepsilon(1,\ldots,1).\tag{10}
\]
Every direction occurs once, so (10) forces \(t_i=\varepsilon\) for all \(i\).

If \(\varepsilon=0\), all \(u_i\) coincide; thus the \(e_i\) are the \(n\) different cube edges incident with one vertex, giving case 1. If \(\varepsilon=1\), every successive pair \(u_{i-1},u_i\) is joined by \(e_i\), and the \(n\) steps traverse every coordinate once. They form a full antipodal geodesic, giving case 2.

Conversely, cyclically ordered edges in one cube vertex star yield a closed turn cycle with trivial covering monodromy. A full antipodal geodesic yields a turn cycle whose last turn joins its last edge to the antipode of its first, so its lifted endpoint is \(\tau e_1\) and its monodromy is one. In either case distinct edge directions make the projected cycle simple and direction-rainbow. The final statement follows from Corollary 2. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (matroidal formulation of unrestricted NORI1).** For an admissible turn cochain \(d\), let
\[
\mathcal R_n=\{C\subseteq E(H_n):
C\text{ is a direction-rainbow simple cycle and independent in }M_n\}.
\]
Then
\[
\boxed{\quad \mu(c)=
\min_{C\in\mathcal R_n}\left(\sum_{t\in C}d(t)-1\right).\quad}\tag{11}
\]
Every sum in (11) is odd. In particular, the unrestricted two-switch conclusion in dimension \(n\) is equivalent to
\[
\boxed{
\text{for every }d\in a+B^1(H_n;\mathbb F_2),
\ \text{some }C\in\mathcal R_n\text{ has }\sum_{t\in C}d(t)\le3.
}\tag{12}
\]
The unrestricted monochromatic conclusion is equivalent to the corresponding bound with sum at most one.

*Proof.* By Theorem 3, the members of \(\mathcal R_n\) are the cyclic turn cycles of full antipodal geodesics. Their \(d\)-sums are odd by (4). For any rooted geodesic, its number of switches is the sum on its corresponding turn cycle with the terminal seam comparison omitted, so it is at least the sum minus one. Conversely, cyclically rotating a geodesic and its root allows any turn of the cycle to be chosen as the omitted comparison. An odd sum contains a turn labeled one; omitting that turn achieves the sum minus one. Taking minima proves (11), from which (12) and the monochromatic version follow. \(\square\)

The graphic-matroid circuits of \(H_n\), the binary even-cycle matroid \(M_n\), and the direction partition together characterize the geodesic witness family without a separate port-compatibility condition. Corollary 2 also shows that the even-cycle matroid itself is invariant under all admissible colorings: the coloring-dependent information relevant to switch minimization is the chosen representative \(d\) of the fixed switching class. Thus a matroidal proof of a switch bound must use quantitative properties of its representative's support on the distinguished rainbow circuits, beyond matroid rank or circuit incidence alone.

**Conjecture 5 (three-turn rainbow-circuit property).** For every \(n\ge3\) and every vertex function \(f:V(H_n)\to\mathbb F_2\), the cochain \(d=a+\delta f\) admits a direction-rainbow simple cycle \(C\) with \(\alpha(C)=1\) and
\[
\boxed{\sum_{t\in C}d(t)\le3.}\tag{13}
\]
Here the sum counts those turns assigned the bit one. This conjecture is equivalent, by Corollary 4, to the unrestricted inequality \(\mu(c)\le2\) for antipodally odd cube-edge colorings. Its one-turn strengthening, with the right-hand side of (13) replaced by one, is equivalent to unrestricted NORI1.

Any proof by circuit exchange must control three coupled properties: the direction partition, nontrivial covering monodromy, and the support weight of the turn cochain. The switching-class representation makes the ambient binary matroid independent of the coloring, while the weight \(d\) retains the quantitative difficulty. A proof that uses only rank or matroid independence cannot distinguish the various colorings in this affine switching class.


### Folded-cube cycle-space presentation and antipodal girth

For \(n\ge3\), let \(Q_n\) denote the binary cube with antipodal map \(\tau\), and put \(G_n=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\) and \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), where \(L\) denotes the line graph. The quotient \(G_n\) is a simple \(n\)-regular graph with \(2^{n-1}\) vertices and \(n2^{n-2}\) edges: two different coordinate directions cannot connect the same antipodal vertex classes for \(n\ge3\).

**Proposition 6 (the folded-cube line graph).** There is a canonical isomorphism
\[
H_n\cong L(G_n).
\tag{1}
\]
Under this isomorphism the two-sheeted covering \(L(Q_n)\to H_n\) is induced by \(Q_n\to G_n\).

*Proof.* Vertices on both sides are pairs of antipodal cube edges. Two pairs are joined precisely when their representatives can meet at a vertex. In \(G_n\) this is incidence of its corresponding edges; simplicity ensures a unique center of incidence. Every turn downstairs lifts uniquely once its first cube edge is chosen, proving the covering assertion. \(\square\)

A star triangle is a triangle formed by three edges incident with one vertex of \(G_n\). A square turn cycle consists of the four successive edges of a square face of \(Q_n\), regarded as four vertices of \(H_n\). Let \(T\) and \(S\) be their respective binary spans in \(Z_1(H_n;\mathbb F_2)\). Write \(\alpha\) for the covering monodromy \(Z_1(H_n;\mathbb F_2)\to\mathbb F_2\).

**Theorem 7 (local generation of even monodromy).** For every \(n\ge3\),
\[
\boxed{\ker\alpha=T+S.}
\tag{2}
\]
The dimensions are
\[
\begin{aligned}
\dim Z_1(H_n)&=n(n-2)2^{n-2}+1,\\
\dim\ker\alpha&=n(n-2)2^{n-2},\\
\dim T&=(n-1)(n-2)2^{n-2},\\
\dim(T+S)/T&=(n-2)2^{n-2}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
\]
In particular, star triangles, square turn cycles, and one antipodal-geodesic cycle span \(Z_1(H_n;\mathbb F_2)\).

*Proof.* Let \(I(G_n)\) be the subdivision graph of \(G_n\), whose vertices are \(V(G_n)\sqcup E(G_n)\). To a turn \(t=\{e,f\}\) at \(v\), assign the incidence chain
\[
\varphi(t)=(e,v)+(v,f).
\tag{4}
\]
This preserves boundaries and induces a linear map \(\varphi:Z_1(H_n)\to Z_1(I(G_n))\cong Z_1(G_n)\). It is onto: every cycle of \(G_n\) lifts to the turn cycle of its successive edges. Its kernel is \(T\). Indeed, different vertex stars use disjoint turn edges, and on each star \(\varphi(z)=0\) means that the turn chain has even degree at every vertex of the clique \(K_n\) of incident edges. The cycle space of a complete graph is generated by its triangles. We therefore have
\[
0\longrightarrow T\longrightarrow Z_1(H_n)
 \xrightarrow{\ \varphi\ }Z_1(G_n)\longrightarrow0,
\tag{5}
\]
with image equal to the whole final space and kernel equal to \(T\).

Let \(\beta:Z_1(G_n)\to\mathbb F_2\) be the monodromy of the cube covering \(Q_n\to G_n\). Tracing contact vertices in a lifted turn walk yields
\(\alpha=\beta\circ\varphi\).

Let \(F\) be the span in \(Z_1(G_n)\) of projected square boundaries of \(Q_n\). We prove \(\ker\beta=F\). Every projected square lifts closed, so \(F\subseteq\ker\beta\). Conversely, express \(z\in\ker\beta\) as a disjoint union of closed trails and connect them by paths used twice to obtain one closed walk \(W\) with incidence vector \(z\) modulo two. Since \(\beta(W)=0\), the walk lifts closed to \(Q_n\). Its binary edge chain lies in the cycle space of the cube, which is spanned by square boundaries: adjacent coordinate steps may be interchanged across squares and immediate backtracks canceled until any closed walk is reduced. Projection gives \(z\in F\). As the turn cycle of a cube square maps under \(\varphi\) to its projected square boundary, \(\varphi(S)=F\). Together with (5), this proves (2).

The \(2^{n-1}\) star cliques are edge-disjoint copies of \(K_n\), each with cycle-space dimension \(\binom{n-1}{2}\). Hence
\(\dim T=2^{n-1}\binom{n-1}{2}\).
The connected graph \(H_n=L(G_n)\) has
\[
|V(H_n)|=n2^{n-2},\qquad
|E(H_n)|=2^{n-1}\binom n2,
\]
giving the first line of (3). A full antipodal geodesic projects to a closed turn cycle whose lift ends at the antipode of its initial edge, so \(\alpha\ne0\). Its kernel consequently has codimension one, giving the remaining lines of (3). The same geodesic cycle adds a generator outside \(\ker\alpha\). \(\square\)

**Corollary 8 (local cochain criterion).** A function \(d:E(H_n)\to\mathbb F_2\) is induced by an antipodally odd binary coloring of cube edges if and only if its sum vanishes on every star triangle and square turn cycle, and its sum equals one on any one specified antipodal-geodesic cycle. The coloring is unique up to global complementation.

*Proof.* Such a coloring makes turn sums equal to covering monodromy, proving necessity. Conversely, Theorem 7 makes the stated conditions equivalent to \(d(z)=\alpha(z)\) for every binary cycle \(z\). The pullback of \(d\) to \(L(Q_n)\) then sums to zero on all cycles and equals the coboundary of a vertex function \(c\), unique up to a constant because \(L(Q_n)\) is connected. Its vertices are cube edges. Invariance of \(d\) under \(\tau\) makes \(c(e)+c(\tau e)\) constant on cube edges; summing around the specified monodromy-one cycle identifies that constant as one. Thus \(c\) is antipodally odd and induces \(d\). \(\square\)

**Theorem 9 (antipodal girth and stability).** If \(C\) is a simple cycle of \(H_n\) with \(\alpha(C)=1\), then
\[
\boxed{|C|\ge n.}
\tag{6}
\]
Equality holds if and only if \(C\) is the cyclic turn cycle of a full antipodal geodesic of \(Q_n\). More quantitatively, let \(|C|=r\), choose a lift of its cyclic edge sequence
\[
e_1,\ldots,e_r,e_{r+1}=\tau e_1,
\]
and let \(u_i\) be the common cube vertex of \(e_i,e_{i+1}\), with \(u_0=\tau u_r\). Write \(s\) for the number of indices with \(u_i=u_{i-1}\), and \(m_j\) for the number of changes \(u_{i-1}\ne u_i\) made in coordinate \(j\). Every \(m_j\) is a positive odd integer, and
\[
\boxed{r-n=s+2\sum_{j=1}^n\frac{m_j-1}{2}.}
\tag{7}
\]

*Proof.* Both \(u_{i-1}\) and \(u_i\) belong to the cube edge \(e_i\). They either coincide or differ only in its direction. Since \(u_r=\tau u_0\), the sequence of contact vertices changes each coordinate an odd number \(m_j\) of times. Therefore \(r=s+\sum_jm_j\), giving (7) and (6). When \(r=n\), the identity forces \(s=0\) and \(m_j=1\) for all \(j\). Thus the lifted edges traverse every direction once from \(u_0\) to \(\tau u_0\), yielding an antipodal geodesic. The converse follows directly by cyclic completion of its turn sequence. \(\square\)

**Corollary 10 (minimal-cycle enumeration).** Both the monodromy-one cycles of length \(n\) and the monodromy-zero direction-rainbow star cycles of length \(n\) number
\[
\boxed{2^{n-2}(n-1)!}
\tag{8}
\]
when cycles are unoriented.

*Proof.* There are \(2^nn!\) directed antipodal geodesics with specified root. Each projected cycle has \(n\) choices of its initial edge-pair, two cyclic orientations, and two lifts, hence \(4n\) preimages. Division gives (8). Independently, every vertex of \(G_n\) supports \((n-1)!/2\) unoriented cyclic orders of its \(n\) incident direction-distinct edges, and \(G_n\) has \(2^{n-1}\) vertices. These star cycles are distinct, giving the same count. \(\square\)

Theorem 9 identifies full antipodal geodesics intrinsically as the shortest cycles with nontrivial covering monodromy. Theorem 7 supplies generators for its monodromy kernel using local triangles and squares. Consequently the turn-weight optimization of Article XI can be formulated over the shortest monodromy-one cycles, with no independent direction-rainbow condition. The support-weight bound needed for unrestricted NORI1 remains open.

### Direction-deleted graphic restrictions and a binary contraction normal form

Let \(n\ge3\), and let \(G_n=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\) be the folded cube under antipodal complementation. Put \(H_n=L(G_n)\), with \(V_i\subseteq V(H_n)\) the vertices corresponding to cube-edge pairs of direction \(i\). Let \(M_n\) be the binary matroid on \(E(H_n)\) represented by the vertex-edge incidence matrix \(B\) of \(H_n\), augmented by a row \(a\) recording the monodromy of the cover \(L(Q_n)\to H_n\). In particular, the cycles of \(M_n\) are the even-degree subgraphs of \(H_n\) having zero covering monodromy.

Fix a direction \(s\), set \(U_s=V(H_n)\setminus V_s\), and write \(m=2^{n-2}=|V_s|\).

**Theorem 1 (direction-deleted graphic flat).** There is a canonical isomorphism, after choosing the coordinate-\(s\) zero layer,
\[
H_n[U_s]\cong L(Q_{n-1}).
\tag{1}
\]
The restriction of \(M_n\) to \(E(H_n[U_s])\) is the graphic cycle matroid of \(L(Q_{n-1})\), of rank
\[
(n-1)2^{n-2}-1.
\tag{2}
\]
Moreover, \(E(H_n[U_s])\) is a flat of \(M_n\). Its complement consists of \(2(n-1)m\) turns, partitioned into \(2m\) families of \(n-1\) turns according to the two endpoints of each direction-\(s\) edge of \(G_n\).

*Proof.* Every antipodal vertex pair of \(Q_n\) has a unique representative with coordinate \(s\) equal to zero. Deleting the direction-\(s\) edges from \(G_n\) identifies its remaining graph with \(Q_{n-1}\) on those representatives. Taking line graphs gives (1).

Every closed walk in this direction-deleted graph lifts to a closed walk in the layer \(x_s=0\) of \(Q_n\). Its covering monodromy is zero. Thus the extra row \(a\) of a matrix representing \(M_n\), restricted to \(E(H_n[U_s])\), lies in the cut space of the connected graph \(H_n[U_s]\). The matroid restriction is graphic, with rank \(|U_s|-1=(n-1)2^{n-2}-1\). Every turn outside this restriction has one endpoint in \(V_s\), so its incidence column has a nonzero entry in the corresponding \(V_s\)-row; all columns of the restriction vanish on that row. Such an outside column lies outside their span, proving flatness.

Each vertex \(v\in V_s\) represents an edge \(e_v\) of \(G_n\) in direction \(s\). At each endpoint of \(e_v\), there are \(n-1\) other incident edges, producing \(n-1\) distinct turns incident with \(v\). Since the direction-\(s\) edges of \(G_n\) form a matching, these are all turns outside the restriction. \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (paired-column contraction).** Let \(T\) be any spanning tree of \(H_n[U_s]\). Contract \(T\) in \(M_n\) and delete the loops arising from \(E(H_n[U_s])\setminus T\). The remaining matroid has rank \(m+1\) and admits over \(\mathbb F_2\) the representation
\[
\boxed{\quad
\{\,e_v^{\,n-1},\ (e_v+z)^{\,n-1}:v\in V_s\,\}
\subseteq\mathbb F_2^{\,V_s}\oplus\mathbb F_2 z .
\quad}
\tag{3}
\]
Here \(e_v^{\,n-1}\) means \(n-1\) parallel copies of the standard vector \(e_v\). The first family represents turns at the endpoint of a selected cube-edge lift with \(s\)-coordinate zero; the second represents turns at its endpoint with \(s\)-coordinate one.

*Proof.* Choose a representative of each antipodal cube-edge pair: for any direction other than \(s\), take its unique edge lying in \(x_s=0\); for every direction-\(s\) pair, choose either one of its two cube edges. Define the reference coloring \(c_0\) to be zero on all selected representatives and one on their antipodes, and let \(a\) be its induced turn cochain on \(H_n\).

A turn between two directions other than \(s\) occurs in the layer \(x_s=0\), giving \(a=0\). A turn involving a direction-\(s\) edge has \(a=0\) when the two incident edges meet at the selected direction-\(s\) representative's endpoint in \(x_s=0\), and \(a=1\) at its endpoint in \(x_s=1\). Indeed, every non-\(s\) edge in the latter layer is antipodal to its selected representative. For the quotient turn, choosing the antipodal lift of both edges leaves their color difference unchanged.

Hence the matrix \(\left(\begin{smallmatrix}B\\a\end{smallmatrix}\right)\) has zero last entry on every edge of \(H_n[U_s]\). Contracting \(T\) identifies all its vertices into one incidence vertex. Deleting the redundant incidence row leaves the \(m\) rows indexed by \(V_s\), together with the monodromy row \(z\). A turn incident with \(v\in V_s\) has incidence vector \(e_v\), with monodromy entry zero or one according to the endpoint family. This gives (3). Every other edge of \(H_n[U_s]\) becomes a loop, since its incidence column belongs to the span of the tree columns and its monodromy entry is zero.

The \(m\) columns \(e_v\), together with any column \(e_v+z\), span \(\mathbb F_2^{m+1}\), proving the rank assertion. \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (independence and four-element circuits).** Delete parallel copies in (3), and put \(P_v=\{e_v,e_v+z\}\) for every \(v\in V_s\). A set of columns is independent if and only if it contains both members of at most one \(P_v\). For distinct \(v,w\), the four columns of \(P_v\cup P_w\) form a circuit. Consequently \(M_n\) has, for each direction \(s\), a rank-\((2^{n-2}+1)\) minor on \(2^{n-1}\) elements represented by
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
I_m&I_m\\
0&\mathbf1^T
\end{pmatrix}.
\tag{4}
\]

*Proof.* In a linear relation among the columns in (3), the \(e_v\)-coordinate forces the two coefficients from each \(P_v\) to be equal. The \(z\)-coordinate then forces the number of fully selected pairs to be even. A nonzero relation therefore exists if and only if at least two complete pairs occur; any two complete pairs form a minimal relation. Deleting duplicate columns gives (4). \(\square\)

The contraction exhibits the covering monodromy as one shared binary degree of freedom across all direction-\(s\) pairs. The normal form holds for every antipodally odd edge coloring because \(M_n\) is independent of the coloring within its prescribed switching class. Direction-rainbow witnesses and integer turn weights remain additional data in applications to switch minimization.

Let \(n\ge3\), let \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and write \(\alpha\) for the monodromy of the double covering \(L(Q_n)\to H_n\). An antipodally odd edge coloring \(c\) induces a binary turn weight \(d\) by
\[
d([\{e,f\}])=c(e)\oplus c(f)
\]
for cube edges \(e,f\) incident at one vertex. For a cycle \(C\) of \(H_n\), put \(w_d(C)=\sum_{t\in C}d(t)\), with the sum taken in the integers.

Consider a simple cycle \(C\) of length \(r\) with \(\alpha(C)=1\). Lift its cyclically ordered vertices to cube edges
\[
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_r,e_{r+1}=\tau e_1.
\]
For \(1\le j\le r\), let \(u_j\) be the common endpoint of \(e_j,e_{j+1}\), and put \(u_0=\tau u_r\). Each pair \(u_{j-1},u_j\) consists of endpoints of \(e_j\). Write
\[
s(C)=|\{j:u_{j-1}=u_j\}|,
\qquad
m_i(C)=|\{j:u_{j-1}\ne u_j,\ e_j\text{ has direction }i\}|.
\]
These numbers are invariant under cyclic reindexing, reversal, and antipodal choice of lift. Since \(u_r=\tau u_0\), each \(m_i(C)\) is positive and odd. Hence, writing
\[
q(C)=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{m_i(C)-1}{2},
\]
we obtain the directional-excess identity
\[
\boxed{|C|=n+s(C)+2q(C).}\tag{1}
\]

**Theorem 1 (monotone contraction of a stationary contact).** If \(s(C)>0\), there is a simple cycle \(C'\) of \(H_n\) such that
\[
\alpha(C')=1,\qquad |C'|=|C|-1,\qquad
s(C')=s(C)-1,\qquad q(C')=q(C),
\tag{2}
\]
and, simultaneously for every admissible turn weight \(d\),
\[
\boxed{w_d(C')\le w_d(C).}\tag{3}
\]
The difference \(w_d(C)-w_d(C')\) is either \(0\) or \(2\).

*Proof.* Choose an index \(j\) with \(u_{j-1}=u_j=v\), and cyclically reindex the lift so that \(2\le j\le r-1\). The three cube edges \(e_{j-1},e_j,e_{j+1}\) are distinct and meet at \(v\). Therefore the two turns
\[
[\{e_{j-1},e_j\}],\quad [\{e_j,e_{j+1}\}]
\]
can be replaced by the single turn \([\{e_{j-1},e_{j+1}\}]\). This removes the vertex \([e_j]\) from \(C\). Since \(C\) is simple and \(r\ge n+1\ge4\), the resulting closed walk \(C'\) is a simple cycle of length \(r-1\). The symmetric difference of the two cycles is a triangle of the clique of turns at \(v\). This triangle has monodromy zero, establishing \(\alpha(C')=\alpha(C)=1\).

The contact vertices of every retained cube edge are unchanged: the two contacts of the removed edge coincide at \(v\). Thus the removed index is the only one counted by \(s\), and the coordinate traversal counts \(m_i\) remain unchanged. This proves (2).

Set \(a=c(e_{j-1})\), \(b=c(e_j)\), and \(z=c(e_{j+1})\). All three colors are compared at the same cube vertex, and
\[
\begin{aligned}
w_d(C)-w_d(C')
&=(a\oplus b)+(b\oplus z)-(a\oplus z)\\
&=2\,\mathbf1_{\{a=z\ne b\}}\ \ge0.
\end{aligned}\tag{4}
\]
The replacement depends only on \(C\), so (3) holds for every antipodally odd edge coloring at once. \(\square\)

**Corollary 2 (moving-cycle normal form).** Every simple cycle \(C\) with \(\alpha(C)=1\) admits a sequence of \(s(C)\) triangle contractions ending at a simple cycle \(C^\circ\) with
\[
\alpha(C^\circ)=1,\quad s(C^\circ)=0,\quad
|C^\circ|=n+2q(C),\quad
w_d(C^\circ)\le w_d(C)
\tag{5}
\]
for every admissible \(d\). Consequently, if \(q(C)=0\), the terminal cycle is a length-\(n\) antipodal-geodesic cycle.

*Proof.* Repeatedly apply Theorem 1. The quantity \(s\) decreases by one at each contraction while \(q\) is preserved. When \(s=0\), (1) gives the length in (5). For \(q=0\), that length is \(n\), and the odd-girth characterization identifies the cycle with a full antipodal geodesic. \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (weighted stability immediately above odd girth).** For every admissible \(d\),
\[
\boxed{
\min_{\substack{C\text{ simple}\\\alpha(C)=1,\ |C|\le n+1}}w_d(C)
=
\min_{\substack{C\text{ simple}\\\alpha(C)=1,\ |C|=n}}w_d(C).
}\tag{6}
\]
In particular, the minimum \(\mu(c)\) of the number of color changes on a full antipodal geodesic satisfies
\[
\mu(c)=
\min_{\substack{C\text{ simple}\\\alpha(C)=1,\ |C|\le n+1}}
w_d(C)-1.
\tag{7}
\]

*Proof.* Odd girth gives \(|C|\ge n\). If \(|C|=n+1\), identity (1) forces \(s(C)=1\) and \(q(C)=0\), so Theorem 1 supplies a length-\(n\) cycle of no greater weight. The reverse inequality follows by inclusion. Equation (7) then follows from cyclic rotation of a full antipodal geodesic: its cyclic turn weight is odd, and omitting any turn of weight one as the terminal seam yields a rooted geodesic with \(w_d(C)-1\) changes. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (the first repeated-direction obstruction).** Let \(C\) have \(\alpha(C)=1\) and \(|C|=n+2\). Either \(s(C)=2,q(C)=0\), in which case \(C\) contracts through a length-\((n+1)\) cycle to a length-\(n\) cycle without increasing any admissible turn weight, or \(s(C)=0,q(C)=1\). In the latter case every contact traverses a cube edge, and its direction sequence traverses one coordinate three times and each other coordinate once.

More generally, if \(\mu(c)\ge4\), every monodromy-one cycle \(C\) with \(w_d(C)\le3\) has \(q(C)\ge1\). Thus a low-weight circuit obstructed from shortening to a geodesic must include repeated coordinate traversal.

*Proof.* The dichotomy at length \(n+2\) follows from \(s+2q=2\), with \(s,q\) nonnegative integers. Apply Corollary 2 in the first case. In the second, \(\sum_i(m_i-1)/2=1\) with all \(m_i\) odd and positive, yielding the asserted direction counts. Finally, if \(q(C)=0\) and \(w_d(C)\le3\), Corollary 2 yields a length-\(n\) cycle of weight at most three, and (7) gives \(\mu(c)\le2\). \(\square\)

The contractions use only triangles within cube-edge stars and work simultaneously for every representative of the admissible switching class. Their scope is determined by the directional excess \(q\). After all stationary contacts are removed, further shortening must address coordinate directions traversed at least three times; such steps need not admit a non-increasing triangle contraction.

Let \(n\ge3\), let \(H=H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and put \(N=|V(H)|=n2^{n-2}\). Let \(B\in\mathbb F_2^{V(H)\times E(H)}\) be the unoriented vertex-edge incidence matrix over \(\mathbb F_2\). Fix \(a\in\mathbb F_2^{E(H)}\) representing the nontrivial covering-monodromy class \(\alpha\), so that \(a(C)=\alpha(C)\) on all binary cycles of \(H\). Every antipodally odd cube-edge coloring determines a turn cochain \(d=a+\delta f\), where \(\delta f=f^TB\); conversely each such cochain arises from an admissible coloring, unique up to complement. We use \(w_d(F)=\sum_{t\in F}d(t)\) for the *integer* support weight of a set of turns \(F\).

Introduce one distinguished element \(p\) outside \(E(H)\), and represent a binary matroid \(\widehat M_n\) on \(E(H)\cup\{p\}\) by the matrix
\[
\widehat A=
\begin{pmatrix} B&0\\ a&1\end{pmatrix}.
\tag{1}
\]
Write \(D_n=\widehat M_n^*\) for its dual. Deletion of \(p\) from \(\widehat M_n\) gives the even-cycle matroid \(M_n\) of the previous Subsections. Since \(B\) has rank \(N-1\), and the bottom row of (1) is independent of the other rows, \(\operatorname{rank}\widehat M_n=N\), and \(\operatorname{rank}D_n=|E(H)|+1-N\).

**Theorem 1 (port-containing cycles and cocircuits).** The binary cycles of \(D_n\) containing \(p\) are precisely
\[
\boxed{X_d=\operatorname{supp}(d)\cup\{p\},
\qquad d=a+\delta f.}
\tag{2}
\]
The cocircuits of \(D_n\) containing \(p\) are precisely
\[
\boxed{Y_C=C\cup\{p\},\qquad
C\text{ a simple cycle of }H\text{ with }\alpha(C)=1.}
\tag{3}
\]
For every such pair,
\[
\boxed{|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+w_d(C)\equiv0\pmod2.}
\tag{4}
\]
The coloring-dependent support \(X_d\) may be a union of several dual circuits; the statement (2) concerns all binary cycles, not just circuits.

*Proof.* The binary cycle space of the dual of a represented binary matroid is the row space of its representing matrix. The row space of (1) consists of \((\delta f,0)\) and \((a+\delta f,1)\), proving (2). A cocircuit of \(D_n\) is a circuit of \(\widehat M_n\). A set \(F\cup\{p\}\) is dependent in \(\widehat M_n\) precisely when its characteristic vector satisfies \(B\mathbf1_F=0\) and \(a(F)=1\). Decompose the Eulerian binary edge set \(F\) into edge-disjoint graph-theoretic simple cycles. At least one has odd monodromy; therefore minimality forces \(F\) to consist of a single simple odd-monodromy cycle. Conversely, an odd-monodromy simple cycle together with \(p\) is a minimal dependent set: a proper nonempty subset of the simple cycle is never Eulerian. This proves (3). Finally,
\[
|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+\sum_{t\in C}d(t)
\]
and \(d(C)=a(C)+(\delta f)(C)=1\) in \(\mathbb F_2\), establishing (4). \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (minimum port cocircuits are antipodal geodesics).** Every cocircuit of \(D_n\) containing \(p\) has size at least \(n+1\), and equality occurs precisely for the circuits \(Y_C\) of (3) whose cycle \(C\) is the cyclic turn cycle of a full antipodal geodesic of \(Q_n\):
\[
\boxed{\mathcal Y_n=
\{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n):p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\}.}
\tag{5}
\]
The cardinality condition in (5), together with the pointed matroid, intrinsically recognizes the geodesic witness family. In particular, no auxiliary direction-rainbow predicate is needed.

*Proof.* The odd-girth theorem proved earlier in Article XI says that every simple cycle \(C\) of \(H\) with \(\alpha(C)=1\) has \(|C|\ge n\), with equality precisely for cyclically completed full antipodal geodesics. For clarity, lift its ordered turn vertices to cube edges \(e_1,\ldots,e_r,e_{r+1}=\tau e_1\). Let \(u_j\) denote the common endpoint of \(e_j,e_{j+1}\), with \(u_0=\tau u_r\). For each \(j\), either \(u_{j-1}=u_j\) or they differ in the direction of \(e_j\). Since \(u_r=\tau u_0\), each of the \(n\) coordinate directions is traversed an odd, hence positive, number of times, giving \(r\ge n\). If \(r=n\), each coordinate is traversed once and no stationary contact occurs, so the edges form a full antipodal geodesic. Conversely, every full antipodal geodesic yields such a length-\(n\) odd-monodromy turn cycle. Apply Theorem 1. \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (cycle–cocircuit intersection formulation).** Let \(\mu(c)\) be the minimum number of color changes in a full antipodal geodesic for a coloring with turn cochain \(d\). Then
\[
\boxed{\mu(c)=
\min_{Y\in\mathcal Y_n}|X_d\cap Y|-2.}
\tag{6}
\]
Consequently the unrestricted two-switch conjecture is equivalent to the following statement about the fixed pointed binary matroid \((D_n,p)\):
\[
\boxed{\forall X\in Z(D_n)\text{ with }p\in X,\quad
\exists Y\in\mathcal Y_n:\ |X\cap Y|\le4.}
\tag{7}
\]
The stronger unrestricted NORI1 assertion is equivalent to requiring \(|X\cap Y|=2\). All intersections in (7) are even by (4).

*Proof.* Theorem 2 identifies \(Y\setminus\{p\}\) with the cyclic turn cycle of a full antipodal geodesic. The cyclic-rotation identity gives the optimal number of switches among roots of the same cyclic path as \(w_d(Y\setminus\{p\})-1\). By (4) that equals \(|X_d\cap Y|-2\). Take the minimum over all cycles and use (2) to translate the universal quantifier. \(\square\)

We next distinguish dual *circuits* from arbitrary dual cycles. Write \(D=\operatorname{supp}(d)\) and let \(H_0(d)=(V(H),E(H)\setminus D)\). In the cube interpretation, \(H_0(d)\) retains precisely the turns joining edges of the same color.

**Theorem 4 (dual-circuit connectivity criterion).** For every admissible turn cochain \(d\),
\[
\boxed{\quad
X_d=D\cup\{p\}\text{ is a circuit of }D_n
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad H_0(d)\text{ is connected}.
\quad}
\tag{8}
\]

*Proof.* By (2), \(X_d\) is a binary cycle of \(D_n\). It is a circuit if and only if it contains no proper nonempty binary cycle. Any nonzero dual cycle contained in \(X_d\) and avoiding \(p\) is of the form \(\operatorname{supp}(\delta g)\) for a nonconstant binary vertex function \(g\) of \(H\). Conversely, if a proper nonzero dual cycle \(X'\subsetneq X_d\) contains \(p\), its disjoint complement \(X_d\setminus X'\) is a nonzero dual cycle avoiding \(p\), again of the form \(\operatorname{supp}(\delta g)\). Thus \(X_d\) is a circuit precisely when there is no nonempty graph cut \(\operatorname{supp}(\delta g)\subseteq D\). Such a cut exists if and only if the graph \(H_0(d)\) is disconnected: one direction takes \(g\) to be a component indicator, and the other observes that a cut contained in \(D\) has no edge joining different \(g\)-classes in \(H_0(d)\). \(\square\)

**Theorem 5 (dual-circuit reduction and even cut penalty).** Let \(d=a+\delta f\) be arbitrary. There exist another admissible turn cochain \(d'\) and a graph cut cochain \(b=\delta g\) such that
\[
\boxed{
d=d'+b\quad\text{over }\mathbb F_2,\qquad
\operatorname{supp}(d')\cap\operatorname{supp}(b)=\varnothing,\qquad
\operatorname{supp}(b)\subseteq\operatorname{supp}(d),
}
\tag{9}
\]
and \(X_{d'}=\operatorname{supp}(d')\cup\{p\}\) is a *circuit* of \(D_n\). Hence the dual-cycle decomposition
\[
\boxed{X_d=X_{d'}\ \dot\cup\
\operatorname{supp}(b)}
\tag{10}
\]
has disjoint supports. For every binary cycle \(C\) of \(H\),
\[
\boxed{w_d(C)=w_{d'}(C)+|\operatorname{supp}(b)\cap C|,
\qquad |\operatorname{supp}(b)\cap C|\equiv0\pmod2.}
\tag{11}
\]

*Proof.* Let the connected components of \(H_0(d)\) be \(K_1,\ldots,K_r\). Contract each \(K_j\) to a vertex, retaining the edges of \(D\) between different components. The resulting multigraph \(J\) is connected because \(H\) is connected. Choose a spanning tree \(T\) of \(J\), bipartition its vertices, and let \(g:V(H)\to\mathbb F_2\) be constant on each \(K_j\), taking opposite values at endpoints of every edge of \(T\). Thus \(b=\delta g\) vanishes on every edge outside \(D\) and equals one on each edge of \(T\). Let \(d'=d+b\). It is admissible because it differs from \(d\) by a cut. Its support is contained in that of \(d\), with the removed edges given by \(\operatorname{supp}(b)\), proving (9). The zero-turn graph \(H_0(d')\) contains every component \(K_j\) and all edges of \(T\); it is connected. Theorem 4 therefore makes \(X_{d'}\) a dual circuit and proves (10). Finally, the supports in (9) are disjoint, giving the integer weight identity in (11), while every cut meets every graph cycle in an even number of edges. \(\square\)

**Limitation and research target.** Theorem 5 is a support-minimizing reduction, but a low-intersection cocircuit for \(X_{d'}\) need not have low intersection with \(X_d\). The added term in (11) can be large. Consequently a proof for port-containing dual *circuits* alone does not establish (7) for arbitrary port-containing dual cycles. A sufficient strengthening would select \(Y\in\mathcal Y_n\) with simultaneous control of
\[
|X_{d'}\cap Y|+|\operatorname{supp}(b)\cap Y|.
\tag{12}
\]
In particular, a zero-cut-penalty witness for each reduction would lift its full intersection bound to the original coloring. The obstruction is now localized to the interaction of minimum port cocircuits with the graph cuts supported on a signature.

Theorem 2 gives an intrinsic matroidal recognition of all geodesic witnesses, Theorem 4 identifies when a coloring support itself becomes a dual circuit, and Theorem 5 decomposes arbitrary colorings into a dual-circuit core and a nonnegative even cut-crossing penalty. These structural statements are valid for every dimension and every admissible coloring.

**Proposition 6 (explicit dual representation and cographic deletion).** Let \(z_1,\ldots,z_r\) be any binary basis of the graphic cycle space \(Z_1(H;\mathbb F_2)\), where \(r=|E(H)|-|V(H)|+1\). Then \(D_n=\widehat M_n^*\) is represented by the binary \(r\times(|E(H)|+1)\) matrix whose \(j\)th row is
\[
\boxed{\bigl(z_j,\alpha(z_j)\bigr).}\tag{13}
\]
Its deletion of the distinguished element is cographic:
\[
\boxed{D_n\setminus p=M(H)^*.}\tag{14}
\]
Thus \(D_n\) is a specified single-element extension of the cographic matroid \(M(H)^*\), and the port column records the covering monodromy on the graphic cycle space.

*Proof.* A vector \((z,t)\) belongs to the kernel of the matrix (1) if and only if \(Bz=0\) and \(a(z)+t=0\). Therefore
\[
\ker\widehat A=\{(z,\alpha(z)):z\in Z_1(H;\mathbb F_2)\}.
\]
The kernel of a binary matrix representing a matroid is the row space of a matrix representing its dual, so the vectors in (13) form a dual representation. Deleting the last column gives the cycle-space basis \(z_1,\ldots,z_r\) of \(H\), which represents the cographic matroid \(M(H)^*\). Equivalently, contracting the column \(p=(0,1)^T\) in (1) removes the monodromy row and leaves the graphic incidence matrix \(B\), and duality exchanges contraction and deletion. \(\square\)

**Geometric interpretation.** Under the covering \(L(Q_n)\to H_n\), the connected components of \(H_0(d)\) are the antipodal orbits of connected monochromatic edge-components upstairs. Theorem 4 therefore translates the dual-circuit condition into a connectivity statement about monochromatic edge components. In Theorem 5 the cut penalty is always even on a geodesic cycle; controlling this penalty jointly with the port-circuit intersection is the additional condition required for a universal low-switch conclusion.

Let \(n\ge3\), and retain the folded-cube line graph \(H=H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), its antipodal monodromy \(\alpha\), and the admissible turn cochain \(d=a+\delta f\). For an edge set or closed walk \(W\) of \(H\), write
\[
w_d(W)=\sum_{\text{traversed turns }t} d(t)
\tag{1}
\]
with integer multiplicity. The parity identity is
\[
w_d(W)\equiv\alpha(W)\pmod2
\tag{2}
\]
for every closed walk \(W\).

Put
\[
H_0(d)=(V(H),\{t:d(t)=0\}).
\]
Let its connected components be \(K_1,\ldots,K_r\). Define the **monochromatic-component quotient** \(J_d\) by contracting every \(K_i\) to one vertex, retaining one edge for each turn \(t\) with \(d(t)=1\). Loops and parallel edges are permitted. Let \(g_{\rm odd}(J_d)\) denote the minimum length of an odd cycle of this multigraph, with a loop counted as a cycle of length one.

**Theorem 1 (odd-girth identity).** For every admissible antipodally odd coloring, in every dimension,
\[
\boxed{\displaystyle
g_{\rm odd}(J_d)=
\min_{\substack{C\subseteq H\text{ a simple cycle}\\
\alpha(C)=1}} w_d(C).}
\tag{3}
\]
In particular, \(J_d\) is nonbipartite and its odd girth is finite and odd.

*Proof.* If \(C\) is a simple cycle with \(\alpha(C)=1\), contract the portions of \(C\) lying in \(H_0(d)\). The result is a closed walk of \(J_d\) of length \(w_d(C)\), which is odd by (2). Any odd closed walk in a multigraph contains an odd cycle of length at most its length. Thus
\[
g_{\rm odd}(J_d)\le w_d(C).
\]

For the reverse inequality, take a shortest odd cycle \(Z\) of \(J_d\). Each of its edges arises from a turn of \(H\) with \(d=1\). At each intervening contracted vertex \(K_i\), join the endpoints of consecutive turns by a path of zero-turn edges inside \(K_i\). This produces a closed walk \(W\) of \(H\) satisfying \(w_d(W)=|Z|\). By (2), \(\alpha(W)=1\). Splitting \(W\) at repeated vertices, and discarding any immediate backtracking, decomposes it into closed subwalks of total weight at most \(|Z|\), at least one of which has nonzero monodromy. Repeating this splitting yields a simple cycle \(C\) with \(\alpha(C)=1\) and \(w_d(C)\le|Z|\). The two inequalities prove (3). The monodromy class is nonzero because an antipodal-geodesic turn cycle has monodromy one, so some such cycle exists; therefore \(J_d\) is not bipartite. \(\square\)

Let \(\mu_{\rm path}(c)\) denote the minimum number of color changes among **arbitrary** paths of \(Q_n\) joining a vertex to its antipode, with no geodesicity requirement. Repeated vertices or edges may be allowed during an intermediate walk: removing a closed detour cannot increase the number of changes of a binary color word, by the triangle inequality for the discrete metric on \(\{0,1\}\).

**Theorem 2 (full antipodal-path duality).** For every antipodally odd coloring,
\[
\boxed{\displaystyle
\mu_{\rm path}(c)=g_{\rm odd}(J_d)-1.}
\tag{4}
\]
In particular, the minimum number of switches on an unrestricted antipodal path is even.

*Proof.* Let \(C\) attain the minimum in (3), with odd weight \(w=w_d(C)\). Lift its cyclic turn sequence to a sequence \(e_1,\ldots,e_m,e_{m+1}=\tau e_1\) of cube edges. If at some cube edge the contact vertices with its predecessor and successor coincide, remove that stationary edge from the turn sequence, replacing two turns in one vertex star by the third side of the corresponding star triangle. The triangle inequality
\[
(c(e_-)\oplus c(e))+(c(e)\oplus c(e_+))
\ge c(e_-)\oplus c(e_+)
\]
shows that each removal does not increase turn weight, and the star triangle has zero monodromy. As established by the stationary-contact contraction theorem earlier in Article XI, repetition ends with a cyclic sequence whose contacts traverse a cube-edge walk from a vertex to its antipode. Its new cyclic turn weight \(w'\) is odd and at most \(w\).

The cyclic sequence of edge colors is antipodally complementary after one traversal. By moving the cut in this cyclic sequence, each comparison in its cyclic turn count can be chosen as the terminal seam of an antipodal walk. As \(w'\) is positive and odd, some turn has weight one. Choosing that turn as the seam yields an antipodal walk with \(w'-1\le w-1\) changes. Erasing self-intersections does not increase the switch count. Thus \(\mu_{\rm path}(c)\le g_{\rm odd}(J_d)-1\).

Conversely, let \(P\) be an antipodal cube-edge path with \(k\) switches. Follow its edge sequence in \(L(Q_n)\). Its last edge is incident with the antipode of the initial vertex, as is the antipode of its first edge; adjoining the latter creates a closed turn walk in \(H\) with monodromy one. If the last edge is already the antipode of the first, no additional turn is needed. The resulting walk has at most \(k+1\) turns of weight one: the original \(k\) switches, plus possibly the terminal seam. Applying the first part of Theorem 1 to this closed walk gives \(g_{\rm odd}(J_d)\le k+1\). Taking a minimizing path proves the reverse inequality. Equation (4) follows; parity of the odd girth makes the minimum even. \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (monochromatic antipodal paths as quotient loops).** The following statements are equivalent:
1. \(J_d\) has a loop;
2. \(\mu_{\rm path}(c)=0\);
3. some connected monochromatic cube-edge component contains a vertex and its antipode;
4. for some monochromatic cube-edge component \(A\), the vertex sets of \(A\) and its antipodal image \(\tau A\) intersect.

Thus the original, nongeodesic Norine antipodal monochromatic-path statement is equivalent to the assertion that every admissible coloring has a loop in its monochromatic-component quotient. Wu and Yang proved that statement in 2026; the geodesic strengthening remains open.

*Proof.* A loop means \(g_{\rm odd}(J_d)=1\), which is equivalent to (2) by Theorem 2. A monochromatic path between antipodal vertices lies within one monochromatic edge-component, proving equivalence of (2) and (3). Finally, if \(v\in A\cap\tau A\), then both \(v\) and \(\tau v\) lie in \(A\), and conversely any antipodal vertex pair lying in \(A\) yields such an intersection. \(\square\)

Let \(\mu_{\rm geo}(c)\) be the minimum number of switches among full antipodal *geodesics*. By the pointed-matroid theorem of the preceding Subsection,
\[
\mu_{\rm geo}(c)=
\min_{\substack{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n)\\
p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1}} |X_d\cap Y|-2.
\tag{5}
\]

**Corollary 4 (geodesicity penalty).** The difference
\[
\boxed{\displaystyle
\Gamma(c)=\mu_{\rm geo}(c)-\mu_{\rm path}(c)
=\min_{\substack{\alpha(C)=1\\|C|=n}}w_d(C)
-\min_{\alpha(C)=1}w_d(C)
}
\tag{6}
\]
is a nonnegative even integer. An unrestricted two-switch counterexample, if one exists, must exhibit one of two phenomena: either \(g_{\rm odd}(J_d)\ge5\), which would also violate the unrestricted nongeodesic two-switch bound, or \(g_{\rm odd}(J_d)\le3\) but \(\Gamma(c)\ge2\). In the latter case, every low-weight odd-monodromy cycle of weight at most three has positive repeated-coordinate excess \(q(C)\ge1\), by the preceding stationary-contact contraction theorem.

*Proof.* The equality follows from Theorem 2 and the cyclic turn formula (5), and parity gives evenness. If the minimum among length-\(n\) odd cycles is at least five, then either the unrestricted odd girth is at least five or there is an odd cycle of weight at most three. Such a cycle cannot have \(q(C)=0\), since the stationary-contact contraction theorem would then produce a length-\(n\) odd cycle of no greater weight, contradicting the assumed geodesic minimum. \(\square\)

Theorem 2 identifies the shortest odd-cycle problem in the pointed binary matroid with the classical unrestricted antipodal-path problem. Equation (6) isolates the additional geodesicity difficulty as a measurable, even-valued defect. In particular, general matroid circuit-cocircuit principles can guarantee small intersections for unrestricted port cocircuits only insofar as they address the nongeodesic problem; the fixed length condition \(|Y|=n+1\) demands further cube geometry. The component-quotient reduction is valid without assuming any degree balance, sparse curvature, or special coloring structure.

**Theorem 5 (maximum-cut extraction of a dual-circuit core).** Let \(D=\operatorname{supp}(d)\), and let \(J=J_d\) be its connected component quotient, retaining loops. Write \(\operatorname{mc}(J)\) for its maximum cut cardinality, with multiplicities. Among admissible cochains \(d'=d+\delta g\) satisfying \(\operatorname{supp}(d')\subseteq D\),
\[
\boxed{\min |\operatorname{supp}(d')|=|D|-\operatorname{mc}(J).}\tag{7}
\]
Every minimizer has connected zero-turn graph \(H_0(d')\); in particular \(X_{d'}=\operatorname{supp}(d')\cup\{p\}\) is a circuit of the pointed dual matroid. If \(S\) is any maximum cut of \(J\), and \(b_S\) its pullback to \(H\), then
\[
\boxed{\operatorname{supp}(d)=\operatorname{supp}(d')\ \dot\cup\ \operatorname{supp}(b_S)}
\tag{8}
\]
for \(d'=d+b_S\) over \(\mathbb F_2\), and every closed walk \(W\) satisfies
\[
\boxed{w_d(W)=w_{d'}(W)+|\operatorname{supp}(b_S)\cap W|,\quad
|\operatorname{supp}(b_S)\cap W|\equiv0\pmod2.}\tag{9}
\]

*Proof.* The support inclusion \( \operatorname{supp}(d+\delta g)\subseteq D\) holds if and only if \(\delta g\) vanishes on every zero-turn edge. Thus \(g\) is constant on each connected component of \(H_0(d)\), and induces a vertex bipartition of \(J\). Precisely the edges crossing that bipartition are deleted from \(D\). This proves (7) and (8).

We claim that the crossing-edge subgraph of every maximum cut in a connected multigraph \(J\) is connected and spans \(V(J)\). Otherwise take one connected component \(U\) of this crossing-edge subgraph. Every edge between \(U\) and its complement is noncrossing, and at least one exists because \(J\) is connected. Reversing the bipartition on all vertices of \(U\) preserves its previously crossing edges and makes each edge from \(U\) to its complement crossing, increasing the cut size. This is impossible. When \(J\) has one vertex the claim is immediate. Consequently, \(H_0(d')\) contains all original zero-turn components and the edges of a connected spanning crossing subgraph, so it is connected. The dual-circuit connectivity theorem identifies \(X_{d'}\) as a dual circuit. Disjointness in (8) gives the weight identity in (9), and cut-cycle orthogonality gives its evenness. \(\square\)

**Proposition 6 (minimal odd-cycle transversals).** For an admissible turn cochain \(d\) on \(H\), the following are equivalent:

(i) \(X_d=D\cup\{p\}\) is a circuit of the pointed dual;

(ii) \(H_0(d)\) is connected;

(iii) \(D\) is an inclusion-minimal edge set meeting every monodromy-one simple cycle of \(H\);

(iv) each turn \(e\in D\) has a monodromy-one simple-cycle witness \(C_e\) satisfying \(C_e\cap D=\{e\}\).

*Proof.* The dual-circuit criterion gives (i) if and only if (ii). If (ii) holds, join the endpoints of any \(e\in D\) by a simple zero-turn path. Adding \(e\) gives a simple cycle of weight one, hence odd monodromy. This proves (iv), which implies (iii) because each \(C_e\) loses its sole intersection when \(e\) is removed.

If (ii) fails, connectivity of \(H\) supplies \(e\in D\) connecting different zero-turn components. A monodromy-one cycle containing \(e\) cannot contain only one edge of \(D\), since the other edges would then connect the distinct zero-turn components. By parity, it contains at least three edges of \(D\). Thus removing \(e\) from \(D\) leaves every monodromy-one cycle intersected, contradicting (iii). Therefore (iii) implies (ii). \(\square\)

The maximum-cut representative is a minimum-cardinality signature among representatives whose support is contained in \(D\). The decomposition (9) exhibits the nonnegative even crossing penalty on every geodesic cycle. Controlling this penalty simultaneously with the core circuit intersection remains necessary for a universal two-switch proof.

**Corollary 7 (Wu–Yang's theorem gives an unconditional two-intersection cocircuit).** The theorem of Hehui Wu and Ningyuan Yang, *A Chain-Level Borsuk--Ulam Obstruction Proof of Norine's Antipodal-Coloring Conjecture*, arXiv:2607.19276 (July 2026), states that every antipodally odd edge coloring of \(Q_n\), \(n\ge2\), has a monochromatic antipodal path, without a geodesicity requirement. Combining that theorem with Theorems 1 and 2 gives, for every \(n\ge3\) and every admissible turn signature \(d\),
\[
\boxed{g_{\rm odd}(J_d)=1,\qquad \mu_{\rm path}(c)=0.}\tag{10}
\]
Equivalently, every \(H_0(d)\) has a connected component containing both endpoints of some turn with \(d=1\). In the pointed binary dual matroid \(D_n\),
\[
\boxed{\displaystyle
\forall X\in Z(D_n)\ (p\in X),\quad
\exists Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n)\ (p\in Y):
\ |X\cap Y|=2.}
\tag{11}
\]
There is no bound on \(|Y|\) in (11). The two-switch *geodesic* conjecture is the strengthening that requires \(|Y|=n+1\) and allows the intersection to be at most four.

*Proof.* Apply the Wu--Yang monochromatic antipodal-path theorem, so \(\mu_{\rm path}(c)=0\). Equation (4) gives \(g_{\rm odd}(J_d)=1\). A loop in \(J_d\) is a turn \(e\) with \(d(e)=1\) whose endpoints are joined by a zero-turn path in \(H_0(d)\). Their union contains a simple monodromy-one cycle \(C\) with \(w_d(C)=1\). Theorem 1 of the preceding pointed-lift Subsection makes \(C\cup\{p\}\) a cocircuit \(Y\) of \(D_n\), and its intersection with \(X_d\) has cardinality \(1+w_d(C)=2\). Every port-containing dual cycle equals \(X_d\) for some admissible signature, so the quantifiers follow. \(\square\)

**Corollary 8 (only geodesicity can obstruct the conjecture).** For every admissible coloring,
\[
\boxed{\Gamma(c)=\mu_{\rm geo}(c),}
\tag{12}
\]
and an obstruction to \(\mu_{\rm geo}(c)\le2\), if one exists, must force every monodromy-one turn cycle of weight one to have positive repeated-direction excess \(q(C)\), or it would contract to a length-\(n\) geodesic turn cycle of weight one. More generally, every odd-monodromy cycle of weight at most three in such an obstruction must have \(q(C)\ge1\). These are unrestricted necessary conditions, and the existence of the weight-one cycles is unconditional by Wu--Yang.

The topological theorem in the cited paper does not constrain the lengths of its monochromatic paths. Consequently (11) does not imply the desired minimum-size cocircuit intersection; that restriction is the remaining issue of Article XI.

### Intrinsic star statistics and quantitative port–cocircuit exchange bounds

Let \(n\ge5\), \(G_n=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), and \(H_n=L(G_n)\). Use the pointed binary matroid \(D_n\) with port \(p\) from the preceding Subsection. Let \(X\) be an arbitrary binary cycle of \(D_n\) containing \(p\), and put \(d(t)=\mathbf1_{\{t\in X\}}\) for \(t\in E(H_n)\). Thus \(d=a+\delta f\), where \(a\) represents covering monodromy. Write
\[
\mathcal Y_n=\{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n):p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\},\quad
I(X)=\min_{Y\in\mathcal Y_n}|X\cap Y|.
\tag{1}
\]
The minimum is even and the optimal antipodal-geodesic switch count is \(I(X)-2\).

For each vertex \(v\) of \(G_n\), its \(n\) incident edges determine a clique \(K_n(v)\) of turns in \(H_n\), with directions \(1,\ldots,n\). Write \(d_{ij}(v)\) for the label on the turn between directions \(i,j\). Since \(d\) sums to zero on star triangles, there is a binary assignment \(s_i(v)\) to the incident directions satisfying
\[
d_{ij}(v)=s_i(v)+s_j(v).
\tag{2}
\]
The assignment is determined up to simultaneous complementation, and therefore
\[
b_X(v)=\min\bigl(\#\{i:s_i(v)=0\},\#\{i:s_i(v)=1\}\bigr)
\tag{3}
\]
is intrinsic to \(X\). In particular, no lift of a cube-edge coloring is needed to evaluate \(b_X(v)\).

Put \(m=\min(k,n-k)\), and define
\[
\lambda_n(k)=
\begin{cases}
0,&m=0,\\
\dfrac{4k(n-k)(m-1)}{n(n-1)(n-2)},&0<m<n/2,\\
\dfrac{4k(n-k)(m-2)}{n(n-1)(n-3)},&m=n/2,
\end{cases}
\quad q_n=\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{3}\right\rfloor,
\quad\Phi_n(k)=\frac{2k(n-k)}{n-1}-\frac{q_n}{2}\lambda_n(k).
\tag{4}
\]
The last branch of \(\lambda_n\) occurs only in even dimension. For the two opposite corners of a projected coordinate square write \(v^{ij}=v\oplus e_i\oplus e_j\) in \(G_n\), and define
\[
\eta_n(k)=
\begin{cases}
0,&m=0,\\
\dfrac{2(m-1)}{n-2}+
\dfrac{\mathbf1_{\{n\ {\rm even},\,k=n/2\}}}{n-3},&m\ge1;
\end{cases}
\tag{5}
\]
\[
\mathscr K(X)=
\frac1{2^{n-1}n(n-1)}
\sum_{v\in V(G_n)}\ \sum_{i\ne j}
[d_{ij}(v)=1,\ d_{ij}(v^{ij})=0]\,
\eta_n(b_X(v)).
\tag{6}
\]
This is a nonnegative statistic determined by the port-containing cycle \(X\).

**Theorem (intrinsic quantitative port intersection).** Every port-containing binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_n\) satisfies
\[
\boxed{\quad I(X)\le
2+2\left\lfloor
\frac{\displaystyle
\frac1{2^{n-1}}\sum_{v\in V(G_n)}\Phi_n(b_X(v))
-\frac{q_n}{2}\mathscr K(X)-1}{2}
\right\rfloor.\quad}
\tag{7}
\]
Consequently, if \(I(X)\ge6\), then
\[
\boxed{\quad
\frac1{2^{n-1}}\sum_v\Phi_n(b_X(v))
-\frac{q_n}{2}\mathscr K(X)\ge5.\quad}
\tag{8}
\]
The bound holds for arbitrary \(X\) in the affine port-cycle family, irrespective of whether \(X\) is a circuit of \(D_n\).

*Proof.* By the pointed-lift representation, reconstruct an antipodally odd coloring \(c\) of the cube edges whose turn cochain is \(d\). For every vertex \(u\) of \(Q_n\), write \(k_u=\#\{i:c_i(u)=1\}\). Antipodal vertices have complementary incident colors and hence \(k_{\bar u}=n-k_u\); equation (2) implies
\[
\frac1{2^n}\sum_{u\in Q_n}\Phi_n(k_u)
=\frac1{2^{n-1}}\sum_{v\in V(G_n)}\Phi_n(b_X(v)).
\tag{9}
\]
The two-corner comparison \(d_{ij}(u)\), \(d_{ij}(u^{ij})\) is invariant under simultaneous antipodal complementation, so the analogous cube average defining the exchange curvature gain equals (6).

For completeness, the cyclic comparison count on a full geodesic with ordered directions \(p_1,\ldots,p_n\) and colors \(w_1,\ldots,w_n\) is
\[
T(P)=\sum_{r=1}^{n-1}[w_r\ne w_{r+1}]
+[w_n\ne1-w_1].
\tag{10}
\]
It is an odd positive integer. Rotating the root across the first coordinate and moving that direction to the end deletes one of these \(n\) cyclic comparisons; choosing a changed comparison gives a full geodesic with \(T(P)-1\) switches. Uniform sampling over cube roots and full coordinate orders gives
\[
\mathbb ET(P)=\frac1{2^n}\sum_u\frac{2k_u(n-k_u)}{n-1}.
\tag{11}
\]
Indeed each turn sees a uniformly sampled cube vertex and an ordered pair of distinct incident directions.

For a consecutive four-direction block \(h,i,j,\ell\), exchange \(i,j\). If \(v\) is the contact vertex after the \(h\)-step and \(w=v^{ij}\), the resulting change in \(T\) is
\[
\Delta=d_{hj}(v)-d_{hi}(v)
+d_{ij}(v^j)-d_{ij}(v^i)
+d_{i\ell}(w)-d_{j\ell}(w),
\tag{12}
\]
where the right-hand side is in the integers, with binary turn labels interpreted as zero or one. By the parity relation around the square, the middle difference vanishes when \(d_{ij}(v)=d_{ij}(w)\), and otherwise has absolute value one. Conditional averaging over the other two directions gives the four-case estimate
\[
\mathbb E|\Delta|\ge
\frac1{2^n}\sum_u\lambda_n(k_u)+\mathscr K(X).
\tag{13}
\]
Here is the quantitative calculation. If the two corner labels are \((1,1)\), varying \(h\) yields the two outer signs with multiplicities \(a,b\), and the triangle inequality gives a mean at least \(2\min(a,b)/(n-3)\). Averaging over \(\ell\) gives \(g_n(k)=2(m-1)/(n-2)\) for \(m<n/2\), and \(g_n(k)=2(m-2)/(n-3)\) for \(m=n/2\). The probability of a bichromatic ordered pair \(i,j\) at the first corner is \(2k(n-k)/(n(n-1))\), giving \(\lambda_n(k)\). For a pair of corner labels \((1,0)\), the averaged absolute change is at least \(g_n'(k)=2(m-1)/(n-2)\); the pair \((0,1)\) contributes the analogous amount after replacing \(v\) by \(v^{ij}\). Relative to the \((1,1)\) baseline, their combined excess is \(2g_n'(k)-g_n(k)=\eta_n(k)\). The case \((0,0)\) has zero change. This establishes (13).

Choose the \(q_n\) disjoint exchange positions \((2,3),(5,6),\ldots\), with one separating position and a neighbor on both sides. Their effects on \(T\) add independently, since the affected turn positions are disjoint. For each exchange choose the better of the two orders. By the swap involution \(\mathbb E\Delta=0\), and
\[
\mathbb E\min(0,\Delta)=-\tfrac12\mathbb E|\Delta|.
\]
Equations (11)--(13) show that some resulting geodesic has odd \(T\) at most the expression preceding the subtraction of \(1\) inside the floor in (7). Rotating its root deletes one changed comparison, making a full geodesic with at most \(2\lfloor(T_{\rm bound}-1)/2\rfloor\) switches. Finally \(I(X)=\mu(c)+2\), proving (7). If \(I(X)\ge6\), the smallest permissible cyclic turn count is at least five, yielding (8). \(\square\)

**Corollary (ten-dimensional port theorem).** Every port-containing cycle \(X\) of \(D_{10}\) meets some minimum port cocircuit \(Y\) in at most four elements:
\[
\boxed{I(X)\le4\qquad(n=10).}
\tag{14}
\]

*Proof.* Here \(q_{10}=3\), and evaluation of (4) for \(k=0,\ldots,5\) gives
\[
\Phi_{10}(k)=0,\ 2,\ 154/45,\ 259/60,\ 71/15,\ 305/63.
\]
The function is symmetric under \(k\mapsto10-k\), and its maximum \(305/63\) is below five. Since \(\mathscr K(X)\ge0\), (7) gives \(I(X)\le4\). \(\square\)

**Corollary (curvature obstruction in dimension eleven).** Suppose \(n=11\) and every star has \(b_X(v)=5\). Let \(\delta(X)\) be the proportion of projected coordinate squares with
\[
d_{ij}(v)+d_{ij}(v^{ij})=1\pmod2.
\tag{15}
\]
Then
\[
\boxed{\ I(X)\le 2+2\left\lfloor
\frac{58/11-(2/3)\delta(X)-1}{2}\right\rfloor.\ }
\tag{16}
\]
In particular, if \(\delta(X)>9/22\), some \(Y\in\mathcal Y_{11}\) satisfies \(|X\cap Y|\le4\).

*Proof.* Under \(b_X(v)=5\), \(\Phi_{11}=58/11\), \(\eta_{11}=8/9\), and a count over the two opposite corners of each curved square shows \(\mathscr K(X)=4\delta(X)/9\). As \(q_{11}=3\), substitute into (7). \(\square\)

The statistical inputs \(b_X(v)\) and \(\mathscr K(X)\) are computed from incidence with local star triangles and opposite corners of projected squares. Thus the bound is intrinsically a restriction on port-containing cycles of \(D_n\), without a separately chosen cube-edge coloring. In comparison, the cut decomposition of a port cycle into a circuit core and a graphic cut can change these integer statistics; the exchange bound applies directly to the original cycle and avoids any assumption that cut penalties vanish.

### Minimum port-cocircuit profiles and universal coordinate prescription

Let \(n\ge3\). Retain the pointed binary matroid \((D_n,p)\) with ground set \(E(H_n)\cup\{p\}\), where \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and write
\[
\mathcal Y_n=\{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n):p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\}.
\]
A minimum port cocircuit \(Y\) corresponds to the cyclic turn sequence \(C=Y\setminus\{p\}\) of a full antipodal cube geodesic, with all \(n\) directions occurring once. For a port-containing binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_n\), set \(d(t)=\mathbf1_{\{t\in X\}}\) for turns \(t\).

Choose an orientation of \(C\) and mark a seam following direction \(i_n\). Write \(i_1,\ldots,i_n\) for the successive directions, and \(t_r\) for the turn joining \(i_r\) to \(i_{r+1}\), cyclically. Define the compatible profiles of this marked cocircuit to be the solutions \(w\in\mathbb F_2^n\) of
\[
w_{i_r}+w_{i_{r+1}}=d(t_r)\quad(r<n),\qquad
w_{i_n}+w_{i_1}+1=d(t_n).
\tag{1}
\]
Since \(d(C)=1\), the system has two solutions, related by global complementation. Define \(\mathscr W(X)\) as the union of solutions from all \(Y\in\mathcal Y_n\), orientations and seams.

**Lemma (profile decoding).** The family \(\mathscr W(X)\) equals the family of direction-indexed full-geodesic edge-color vectors for either antipodally odd coloring reconstructed from \(X\). Moving the marked seam across its first direction \(i\) sends a profile \(w\) to \(w+e_i\). The deck involution sends \(w\) to \(w+\mathbf1\).

*Proof.* Lift the ordered turn cycle to cube edges \(e_1,\ldots,e_n,e_{n+1}=\tau e_1\). The first \(n-1\) equations in (1) assert that each incident-edge disagreement equals the turn label. At the closing turn the final edge is compared with the antipode of the initial edge, giving the additional one. The two solutions correspond to the antipodal choices of lifted root, and every geodesic has a marked turn cycle of this form. Rotating the initial direction to the end preserves the other edges and replaces the moved edge by its antipode, changing that profile coordinate by one. \(\square\)

Let \(B_k\) be the assertion that every arbitrary binary coloring of the undirected edges of \(Q_k\) has a spanning antipodal geodesic with at most one change. For \(n>k\) and a fixed set \(S\subseteq[n]\) of \(k\) directions, let \(P_{n,S}\) be
\[
\forall X\in Z(D_n),\ p\in X,\qquad
\{w|_S:w\in\mathscr W(X)\}=\mathbb F_2^S.
\tag{2}
\]

**Theorem (pointed-matroid multifacet bridge).** For every \(k\ge2\), \(n>k\), and \(S\subset[n]\) with \(|S|=k\),
\[
\boxed{B_k\Longleftrightarrow P_{n,S}.}
\tag{3}
\]

*Proof.* Suppose \(B_k\). Reconstruct from any \(X\) an antipodally odd cube coloring \(c\), and fix a desired vector \(t\in\mathbb F_2^S\). Write \(Q_n=Q_S\times Q_D\), with \(D=[n]\setminus S\ne\varnothing\), and fix an exterior vector \(z\). Define the edge coloring of the lower \(S\)-face by \(h_i(u)=c_i(u,z)+t_i\). By \(B_k\), choose an antipodal geodesic in this face with at most one change; reverse it if necessary so its color word is a zero block \(U\) followed by a one block \(V\). If it runs
\[
u_0\xrightarrow{U}u_a\xrightarrow{V}\bar u_0,
\]
begin a full \(Q_n\) geodesic at \((u_a,z)\), traverse \(U\) backwards to \((u_0,z)\), traverse all directions of \(D\), then traverse the reverse of the \(Q_S\)-antipodal image of \(V\) in the upper exterior face. The \(U\) edges have color \(t_i\); the \(V\) edges are global antipodes of the lower one-block edges and likewise have color \(t_i\). This full geodesic gives a profile in \(\mathscr W(X)\) restricting to \(t\).

Conversely suppose \(P_{n,S}\), and let \(h\) be any edge coloring of \(Q_S\). Choose exterior direction \(s\in D\) and a coordinate \(i_0\in S\). Define an antipodally odd coloring of \(Q_n\), using vertices \((u,z)\), by
\[
c_i(u,z)=
\begin{cases}h_i(u),&z_s=0,\\1+h_i(\bar u),&z_s=1,\end{cases}
\ (i\in S);\qquad c_j(u,z)=u_{i_0}\ (j\in D).
\tag{4}
\]
These formulas are invariant under flipping the coordinate of their traversed edge and are complemented by global antipodality. Obtain the associated port cycle \(X\). By \(P_{n,S}\), there is a full geodesic whose \(S\)-edges all have color zero. Reverse it so its unique \(s\)-step runs from \(z_s=0\) to \(z_s=1\). Let \(U,V\) be its \(S\)-direction subsequences before and after the \(s\)-step, ignoring all other exterior steps. The projected \(U\)-edges have \(h\)-color zero, while the \(Q_S\)-antipodal images of the projected \(V\)-edges have \(h\)-color one. Reversing \(U\) and following the reversal of the antipodal image of \(V\) gives a spanning \(Q_S\) geodesic with word \(0^{|U|}1^{|V|}\). Thus \(B_k\) holds. \(\square\)

**Corollary (seven-coordinate marginal universality).** Every port-containing binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_n\) satisfies
\[
\boxed{\{w|_S:w\in\mathscr W(X)\}=\mathbb F_2^S
\qquad\bigl(|S|\le\min(7,n)\bigr).}
\tag{5}
\]
For \(n\le8\), every vector of \(\mathbb F_2^n\) occurs as a profile.

*Proof.* The established geodesic Norin theorem through dimension eight, combined with the Leader–Long implication, gives \(B_k\) for every \(k\le7\). Apply (3). For \(n\le8\), independently toggle the cube-edge color of each coordinate direction according to a prescribed full profile; this preserves antipodal oddness. Apply the proved monochromatic geodesic theorem in that dimension, then undo the direction toggles. The remaining claims follow by projection. \(\square\)

The next theorem controls polynomial relations involving arbitrarily many directions. Its conclusion is independent of the bounded-coordinate marginal property (5).

**Theorem (quadratic independence).** For every port-containing cycle \(X\) and every multilinear polynomial
\[
q(w)=a_0+\sum_i b_iw_i+\sum_{i<j}a_{ij}w_iw_j
\quad\text{over }\mathbb F_2,
\tag{6}
\]
the identity \(q(w)=0\) for all \(w\in\mathscr W(X)\) forces every coefficient to vanish. Equivalently,
\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{span}_{\mathbb F_2}\{(1,(w_i)_i,(w_iw_j)_{i<j}):w\in\mathscr W(X)\}
=\mathbb F_2^{1+n+\binom n2}.}
\tag{7}
\]

*Proof.* Recover a cube-edge coloring \(c\) from \(X\), and suppose \(q\) vanishes. Extend \(a_{ij}=a_{ji}\) and put \(a_{ii}=0\). The root rotation in the profile lemma, applied to a geodesic whose first direction is \(i\), yields
\[
b_i+\sum_{j\ne i}a_{ij}w_j=0.
\tag{8}
\]
Fix either facet perpendicular to direction \(i\). Prepending an \(i\)-edge to any antipodal geodesic of that facet shows that the edge cochain \(\omega_j(x)=a_{ij}c_j(x)\), \(j\ne i\), has constant total sum \(b_i\) on all facet-spanning geodesics.

We use an elementary closed-integral lemma. If an undirected edge weighting of a cube has constant sum on all full antipodal geodesics, every square has weight sum zero, and antipodal edges within that cube have equal weights. Indeed, exchange two successive directions at the start of a geodesic to obtain square closure. Integrating a square-closed weighting gives a vertex potential \(\phi\). Its antipodal difference \(\phi(x)+\phi(\bar x)\) equals the constant geodesic integral. Taking derivatives along edges yields antipodal equality.

Complementing the root of the full geodesic in (8) complements every \(w_j\), so
\[
\sum_{j\ne i}a_{ij}=0.
\tag{9}
\]
Within an \(i\)-facet, its antipode is \(x\mapsto\bar x^i\). The closed-integral lemma and \(c_j(\bar x^i)=1+c_j(x^i)\) imply
\[
a_{ij}=1\ \Longrightarrow\ c_j(x)+c_j(x^i)=1.
\tag{10}
\]
Square closure of the same facet cochain gives, for distinct \(i,j,k\),
\[
a_{ij}\bigl(c_j(x)+c_j(x^k)\bigr)
=a_{ik}\bigl(c_k(x)+c_k(x^j)\bigr).
\tag{11}
\]

Form the graph on \([n]\) with edge \(ij\) when \(a_{ij}=1\). If \(ij,jk\) are edges, (10)--(11) force \(ik\) to be an edge. Its connected components are therefore cliques. Equation (9) implies every clique has odd order. Suppose some component \(B\) has an edge, choose \(j\in B\), and use (10) for \(k\in B\setminus\{j\}\) and (11) for \(k\notin B\). Together with undirectedness in direction \(j\), these coordinate derivatives give
\[
c_j(x)=\gamma_j+\sum_{k\in B\setminus\{j\}}x_k.
\tag{12}
\]
Since \(|B|\) is odd, the sum has an even number of coordinates and is invariant under global complementation, contradicting antipodal oddness of \(c_j\). Hence all \(a_{ij}=0\). Equation (8) forces every \(b_i=0\), and evaluation anywhere forces \(a_0=0\). This proves (7). \(\square\)

**Corollary (profile diversity).** Every port-containing cycle \(X\) satisfies
\[
\boxed{|\mathscr W(X)|\ge
\max\left\{2^{\min(n,7)},\
2\left\lceil\frac{1+n+\binom n2}{2}\right\rceil\right\}.}
\tag{13}
\]
For \(n\le8\) equality \(|\mathscr W(X)|=2^n\) holds.

*Proof.* The first bound follows from (5), and the second from the spanning vectors (7), noting that \(\mathscr W(X)\) is closed under complementation and therefore has even cardinality. The small-dimensional equality follows from the complete-profile conclusion of (5). \(\square\)

All profile information here is recovered from a binary port cycle paired with a *marked* minimum port cocircuit; the seam and antipodal choice retain the endpoint memory lost by taking an unmarked intersection size. The two theorems forbid, respectively, missing low-dimensional coordinate marginals and nonzero quadratic annihilators of the full marked-cocircuit family.

### Connected minimum port cocircuits and their intersection spectrum

Let \(n\ge3\). Write \(G_n=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), \(H_n=L(G_n)\), and let \(D_n\) be the pointed binary matroid with distinguished element \(p\) whose cycles containing \(p\) are \(X_d=\operatorname{supp}(a+\delta f)\cup\{p\}\). Here \(a\) represents the nonzero covering monodromy on \(H_n\). Denote by
\[
\mathcal Y_n=\{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n):p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\}
\]
the minimum port-containing cocircuits. They are precisely \(Y_C=C\cup\{p\}\), with \(C\) the turn cycle of a full antipodal cube geodesic.

Two elements \(Y,Y'\in\mathcal Y_n\) are *adjacent* when they have representatives that are rooted full antipodal geodesics with the same initial cube vertex and direction orders differing by the interchange of two consecutive directions.

**Theorem 1 (connected bounded exchanges).** The adjacency graph on \(\mathcal Y_n\) is connected. For adjacent \(Y,Y'\),
\[
\boxed{|Y\triangle Y'|\le6,\qquad
p\notin Y\triangle Y',\qquad
Y\triangle Y'\in\ker\alpha\subseteq Z_1(H_n;\mathbb F_2).}
\tag{1}
\]
For every binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_n\) containing \(p\),
\[
\boxed{\bigl||X\cap Y|-|X\cap Y'|\bigr|\le2.}
\tag{2}
\]

*Proof.* Let a rooted full geodesic have direction order \((i_1,\ldots,i_n)\). Exchanging consecutive \(i_j,i_{j+1}\) replaces the two-edge cube-square route between the same endpoints. Its lifted cyclic sequence of turns changes only at the comparisons immediately before, between, and immediately after the two exchanged edges. Thus each of the two projected turn cycles has at most three turn edges absent from the other; the distinguished element \(p\) belongs to both. This proves the support bound in (1).

Both turn cycles have monodromy one. Their symmetric difference is an Eulerian binary edge chain with monodromy zero, proving the remaining assertions of (1).

To prove connectedness, work first with rooted pairs \((x,\pi)\), where \(x\in Q_n\) and \(\pi\in S_n\). Adjacent transpositions connect every pair of direction orders at fixed root. In addition, the operation
\[
(x,(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_n))
\longmapsto
(x^{i_1},(i_2,\ldots,i_n,i_1))
\tag{3}
\]
preserves the projected cyclic turn cycle: it cyclically moves the root across the first edge and replaces that edge by its antipodal mate. To change a prescribed root \(x\) to \(x^j\), move \(j\) to the first position by adjacent transpositions, apply (3), and then reorder by adjacent transpositions. Single-coordinate root changes connect the entire cube, so any two rooted pairs are connected by such operations. After quotienting out operations (3), only adjacent-transposition moves remain; the graph of projected cycles, equivalently \(\mathcal Y_n\), is connected.

For any port-containing binary cycle \(X\), cycle–cocircuit orthogonality gives \(|X\cap Y|\equiv|X\cap Y'|\equiv0\pmod2\). Moreover, at most three elements leave and at most three enter the cocircuit during an adjacent exchange. The integer intersection counts therefore differ by at most three; their difference is even and hence has magnitude at most two. This proves (2). \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (gap-free even intersection spectrum).** For every \(n\ge3\) and every binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_n\) containing \(p\), put
\[
I_{\min}(X)=\min_{Y\in\mathcal Y_n}|X\cap Y|,
\qquad
I_{\max}(X)=\max_{Y\in\mathcal Y_n}|X\cap Y|.
\]
Then
\[
\boxed{\{\,|X\cap Y|:Y\in\mathcal Y_n\,\}
=\{I_{\min}(X),I_{\min}(X)+2,\ldots,I_{\max}(X)\}.}
\tag{4}
\]
Equivalently, for an arbitrary antipodally odd coloring, the cyclic turn counts of full antipodal geodesics attain every odd integer between their minimum and maximum; their optimally rotated switch counts attain every even integer between the corresponding endpoints.

*Proof.* Choose cocircuits realizing the minimum and maximum, and join them by an adjacency path given by Theorem 1. All intersection numbers along this path are even and consecutive values differ by at most two. Every intermediate even integer must therefore appear. Conversely every intersection number belongs to the even interval between its extrema. For the coloring interpretation, if \(d=\mathbf1_{X\setminus\{p\}}\), the turn count of a full geodesic with cocircuit \(Y\) is \(|X\cap Y|-1\), and cyclic root rotation deletes a changed comparison to yield \(|X\cap Y|-2\) switches. \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (interpolation from separate witnesses).** Suppose a port-containing cycle \(X\) has minimum cocircuits \(Y_-\) and \(Y_+\) satisfying
\[
|X\cap Y_-|\le2r,\qquad |X\cap Y_+|\ge2s
\]
for integers \(1\le r\le s\). Then every even integer between \(2r\) and \(2s\) occurs as \(|X\cap Y|\) for some \(Y\in\mathcal Y_n\). In particular, any lower bound on a *maximum* intersection furnished by local star statistics can be combined with a bound on the *minimum* to furnish witnesses at each intermediate switch count.

*Proof.* Apply (4); the two hypotheses put the interval \([2r,2s]\) inside the achieved spectrum. \(\square\)

Theorem 1 makes the minimum-port-cocircuit family a connected exchange system with local differences in the even-monodromy cycle space generated by star triangles and cube-square cycles. Theorem 2 is an unrestricted integer-valued consequence of this geometry; it does not require \(X\) to be a circuit and imposes no balance or affine-coloring hypothesis.

### Extremal port intersections and exterior-square signatures

Fix \(n\ge4\). Let \(D_n\) be the pointed binary matroid with port \(p\), and let \(X\in Z(D_n;\mathbb F_2)\) contain \(p\). Write \(d(t)=\mathbf1_{\{t\in X\}}\) for turns \(t\) of the folded cube line graph \(H_n\). Its shortest port-cocircuit intersection parameter is
\[
I(X)=\min\{|X\cap Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n),\ p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\}.
\tag{1}
\]
The minimum switch count in full antipodal geodesics of the recovered cube-edge coloring equals \(I(X)-2\). We formulate the finite-face completion constraints of Article X entirely through turn chains and the port-cocircuit intersection parameter.

Let \(F\) be a coordinate face of codimension \(t\), with free-direction set \(D\), exterior-direction set \(T=[n]\setminus D\), and \(1\le|D|,|T|\). For a geodesic \(P=(e_1,\ldots,e_{|D|})\) spanning \(F\), let
\[
A(P)=\{\{[e_j],[e_{j+1}]\}:1\le j<|D|\}\subseteq E(H_n),\qquad
r_X(P)=|A(P)\cap X|.
\tag{2}
\]
Here the projected consecutive edge pairs are turns, and \(r_X(P)\) is their integer support weight. If \(P,Q\) terminate at the same cube vertex \(x\), let \(t_x(P,Q)\in E(H_n)\) be the turn joining their last edges.

**Theorem 1 (port intersection completion and terminal separation).** Let \(P\) span a codimension-\(t\) face, and put \(r=r_X(P)\). Then
\[
\boxed{I(X)\le2+2\left\lfloor\frac{r+t}{2}\right\rfloor.}
\tag{3}
\]
If \(P,Q\) span the same face, end at the same vertex, have \(r_X(P),r_X(Q)\le r\), and \(t_x(P,Q)\in X\), then
\[
\boxed{I(X)\le2+2\left\lfloor\frac{r+t-1}{2}\right\rfloor.}
\tag{4}
\]

*Proof.* The cochain \(d\) reconstructs an antipodally odd edge coloring \(c\), unique up to complementation. Its disagreements between consecutive edges are the labels \(d\), so \(r_X(P)\) is the number of switches along \(P\). Append the \(t\) exterior directions in any order; the resulting path is an antipodal geodesic of \(Q_n\), with at most \(r+t\) switches. The global minimum switch count is even, because cyclic root rotation removes one switch whenever that path has an odd number of switches. It is thus at most \(2\lfloor(r+t)/2\rfloor\). The identity \(I(X)=\mu(c)+2\) gives (3).

For (4), membership \(t_x(P,Q)\in X\) says that the terminal edges of \(P,Q\) have opposite colors. Fix one exterior geodesic \(W\) from \(x\). Its first edge matches the terminal color of one of \(P,Q\); append \(W\) to that path. The seam causes no switch, and the other exterior comparisons contribute at most \(t-1\) switches. Apply the even-minimum reduction and the intersection identity again. \(\square\)

For directions \(i\ne j\) incident at a cube vertex \(y\), write \(d_{ij}([y])\) for the label of their turn in the vertex-star clique of \(H_n=L(G_n)\). All such labels are invariant under replacing \(y\) by its antipode. For \(S\subseteq T\) put \(x^S=x\oplus\sum_{i\in S}e_i\).

**Theorem 2 (forced star-cut pattern on an exterior cube).** Suppose \(P\) spans \(F\), ends at \(x\in F\), and has \(r=r_X(P)\) internal labeled turns. If
\[
\boxed{I(X)\ge r+t+2,}
\tag{5}
\]
then \(r+t\) is even, every completion of \(P\) by an ordering of \(T\) has \(r+t\) switches, and for every \(S\subseteq T\) and distinct \(i,j\in T\),
\[
\boxed{d_{ij}([x^S])=\mathbf1_{\{i\in S\}}+\mathbf1_{\{j\in S\}}\pmod2.}
\tag{6}
\]
In particular, every coordinate square entirely contained in the exterior \(t\)-cube at \(x\) has zero coloring curvature:
\[
\boxed{d_{ij}([x^S])=d_{ij}([x^{S\triangle\{i,j\}}])\qquad
(i,j\in T,\ S\subseteq T).}
\tag{7}
\]

*Proof.* A completion of \(P\) uses each exterior direction once. It has at most \(r+t\) switches, since only \(t\) additional comparisons are introduced. Condition (5), together with \(I(X)-2=\mu(c)\), forces every such completion to have at least \(r+t\) switches. Thus every newly introduced comparison must be a switch. As the minimum of full switch counts is even, \(r+t\) must be even.

Let \(q\in\mathbb F_2\) be the color of the final edge of \(P\). All exterior paths beginning at \(x\) therefore have successive edge colors
\[
1+q,\quad q,\quad1+q,\quad q,\quad\ldots
\tag{8}
\]
in their traversal order. Every exterior cube edge \(\{x^S,x^{S\cup\{i\}}\}\), with \(i\notin S\), occurs as the \((|S|+1)\)-st edge of some such path. Its color is
\[
1+q+|S|\pmod2.
\tag{9}
\]
At a vertex \(x^S\), the exterior direction-\(i\) edge has color \(1+q+|S|\) if \(i\notin S\), and \(q+|S|\) if \(i\in S\). Taking the difference of two such incident edge colors gives (6), independently of the choice of \(q\). Replacing \(S\) by \(S\triangle\{i,j\}\) flips both membership indicators, leaving their sum unchanged; this proves (7). \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (flat exterior-square exclusions for hypothetical high intersection).** Suppose \(I(X)\ge6\).

(a) Every codimension-two face has no spanning geodesic \(P\) with \(r_X(P)\le1\). If such a face has a spanning geodesic with \(r_X(P)=2\), terminating at \(x\) with exterior directions \(a,b\), then
\[
d_{ab}([x])=d_{ab}([x^{ab}])=0,\qquad
d_{ab}([x^a])=d_{ab}([x^b])=1.
\tag{10}
\]
Consequently its exterior square has zero curvature. No two such low-cost terminal geodesics can have opposite terminal colors, equivalently their terminal-edge turn cannot lie in \(X\).

(b) Every codimension-three face has no monochromatic spanning geodesic. If it has a spanning geodesic with \(r_X(P)=1\) terminating at \(x\), then every exterior vertex star and every exterior square obeys (6)--(7), and no two one-turn terminal geodesics can have their terminal-edge turn in \(X\).

*Proof.* For codimension two, (3) with \(r\le1\) would give \(I(X)\le4\). With \(r=t=2\), Theorem 2 applies because \(I(X)\ge6=r+t+2\), yielding (10). For two such terminal paths, (4) gives \(I(X)\le4\) whenever their final-edge turn lies in \(X\), a contradiction. For codimension three, (3) with \(r=0\) gives \(I(X)\le4\); with \(r=1,t=3\), Theorem 2 gives (6)--(7). The same use of (4) excludes opposite terminal phases. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (curvature-positive squares cannot support two-turn terminals).** If \(I(X)\ge6\), fix distinct directions \(a,b\) and a coordinate square \(S\) parallel to them with
\[
d_{ab}([x])\ne d_{ab}([x^{ab}])
\tag{11}
\]
at opposite corners. No geodesic spanning the codimension-two face perpendicular to \(a,b\), terminating at the corresponding corner \(x\), can have only two turns in \(X\).

*Proof.* Such a path would satisfy Corollary 3(a), which forces equality of the two labels in (11). \(\square\)

Equations (6)--(7) transfer the face-completion rigidity of Article X into a phase-free condition on the cycle \(X\): a locally extremal partial turn chain forces the restriction of \(X\) to each exterior star to be the cut separating directions already flipped from directions not yet flipped. Theorem 1 supplies a complementary two-chain certificate for an intersection at most four. These assertions hold for arbitrary port-containing binary cycles, including those which decompose into several dual circuits.

### Odd-dimensional port cycles: square-derivative rigidity and terminal holes

Let \(n\ge5\) be odd, let \((D_n,p)\) be the pointed binary matroid of the antipodal turn quotient \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and let \(X\in Z(D_n)\) contain \(p\). Put \(d(t)=\mathbf1_{\{t\in X\}}\) and
\[
I(X)=\min\{|X\cap Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n),\ p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\}.
\tag{1}
\]
Every \(X\) in this statement is an admissible turn cochain, so the star triangle sums and the square-turn sums of \(d\) vanish.

For each unordered direction pair \(i,j\), the coordinate squares of \(Q_n\) form \(2^{n-3}\) antipodal pairs. Let \(s\) be such a pair, and choose a representative square with corners \(u,u^i,u^j,u^{ij}\). Define two local derivatives in terms of the port cycle alone:
\[
\partial_jd_i(s)=d_{ij}([u])+d_{ij}([u^j]),\qquad
\partial_id_j(s)=d_{ij}([u])+d_{ij}([u^i])
\quad\text{in }\mathbb F_2.
\tag{2}
\]
Here \([u]\) is the vertex of \(G_n=Q_n/\tau\), and \(d_{ij}([u])\) is the turn between the direction-\(i\) and direction-\(j\) edges incident with \([u]\). Square identities and antipodal invariance show that (2) is independent of the chosen square corner and antipodal representative. Define
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathfrak B_{ij}(X)&=\{s:(\partial_jd_i(s),\partial_id_j(s))\ne(1,1)\},\\
\mathfrak D(X)&=\sum_{i<j}|\mathfrak B_{ij}(X)|,\\
\mathfrak Z_i(X)&=\sum_{j\ne i}\#\{s\text{ of type }(i,j):\partial_jd_i(s)=0\},\\
\mathfrak K(X)&=\sum_{i<j}\#\{s:\partial_jd_i(s)+\partial_id_j(s)=1\}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{3}
\]
All quantities are intrinsic incidence statistics of \(X\) and the direction-labeled folded cube.

**Theorem (square-derivative deficit and sharp rigidity).** Every port-containing cycle \(X\) satisfies
\[
\boxed{\mathfrak Z_i(X)\ge2^{n-3},\qquad
\mathfrak K(X)\ge2^{n-3},\qquad
\mathfrak D(X)\ge(n+1)2^{n-4}.}
\tag{4}
\]
Equality in the last inequality implies
\[
\boxed{I(X)=2.}
\tag{5}
\]
In particular,
\[
\boxed{\quad I(X)\ge6\ \Longrightarrow\
\mathfrak D(X)\ge(n+1)2^{n-4}+1.\quad}
\tag{6}
\]
The lower bound in (4) is attained for every odd \(n\).

*Proof.* Reconstruct an antipodally odd undirected-edge coloring \(c_i(u)\) from \(X\). If \(\kappa_{ij}(u)\) denotes the color sum around an \((i,j)\)-square, the turn equations give
\[
\partial_jd_i(s)=c_i(u)+c_i(u^j),\qquad
\partial_id_j(s)=c_j(u)+c_j(u^i),
\tag{7}
\]
and \(\kappa_{ij}(s)=\partial_jd_i(s)+\partial_id_j(s)\). These expressions are antipodally invariant.

Fix \(i\), and regard \(c_i\) as a Boolean function of the even number \(n-1\) of coordinates other than \(i\). Put
\[
f_i(y)=(-1)^{c_i(y)+\sum_{j\ne i}y_j}.
\tag{8}
\]
Antipodal oddness of \(c_i\) makes \(f_i(\bar y)=-f_i(y)\), so its constant Walsh coefficient vanishes. The derivative of \(f_i\) along coordinate \(j\) is nonzero precisely when \(\partial_jd_i(s)=0\). Counting all directional edges, using the Walsh expansion and Parseval, yields
\[
2\mathfrak Z_i
=2^{n-2}\sum_{S\ne\varnothing}|S|\widehat f_i(S)^2
\ge2^{n-2}\sum_{S\ne\varnothing}\widehat f_i(S)^2
=2^{n-2},
\tag{9}
\]
proving the first inequality.

Next reverse a complete coordinate order by adjacent transpositions, exchanging each unordered direction pair once. The parity of the sum of edge colors on the reversed geodesic differs from the original by \(n\bmod2=1\), since its word is the complemented reversal. Each exchanged pair contributes the curvature \(\kappa_{ij}(s)\) of the crossed square. Hence every such reversal has an odd number of curved squares. Average over all cube roots: a fixed pair of directions crosses each of its \(2^{n-2}\) cube squares equally often. Thus at least \(2^{n-2}\) cube squares have curvature one in total, or at least \(2^{n-3}\) antipodal pairs of them. This proves the middle inequality of (4).

On each square with derivative pair \((1,1)\), the contributions to \((\mathfrak D,\sum_i\mathfrak Z_i,\mathfrak K)\) are \((0,0,0)\). A square with \((0,0)\) contributes \((1,2,0)\), and one with unequal derivatives contributes \((1,1,1)\). Consequently
\[
2\mathfrak D=\sum_i\mathfrak Z_i+\mathfrak K
\ge(n+1)2^{n-3},
\tag{10}
\]
giving the final inequality in (4).

Suppose equality holds. Equality in (9) for every \(i\) implies \(f_i\) has Walsh degree one. A degree-one function taking values in \(\{\pm1\}\) is a signed coordinate character: squaring its Walsh expansion and comparing cross coefficients shows at most one linear coefficient is nonzero. Hence for each \(i\) there is \(p(i)\ne i\) and \(a_i\in\mathbb F_2\) such that
\[
c_i(u)=a_i+\sum_{j\notin\{i,p(i)\}}u_j.
\tag{11}
\]
Its derivative satisfies
\[
\partial_jd_i(s)=1+[p(i)=j],\qquad
\kappa_{ij}(s)=[p(i)=j]+[p(j)=i].
\tag{12}
\]
The middle inequality of (4) is also an equality, so there is precisely one unordered coordinate pair with nonzero curvature. Since \(p\) has one outgoing arrow from each of the odd number \(n\) of directions, it follows that \(n-1\) directions form reciprocal pairs \(\{u_r,v_r\}\) and one remaining direction \(w\) points to a member of one of these pairs.

We give a monochromatic full geodesic for every coloring (11) of that form. Let \(t_i\) be the position of coordinate \(i\) in the chosen permutation. Choose the permutation with
\[
t_{u_r}+t_{v_r}=1+a_{u_r}+a_{v_r}\pmod2
\tag{13}
\]
for every reciprocal pair. Such a permutation is obtained successively from the remaining odd number of positions: a pair requiring equal parity takes two positions of the majority parity, and one requiring different parity takes one of each; the remaining parity classes continue to differ by one. The final position belongs to \(w\). Write \(S_i\) for the preceding directions and
\[
\eta_i=a_i+(t_i-1)+[p(i)\in S_i].
\tag{14}
\]
Equation (13) gives \(\eta_{u_r}=\eta_{v_r}=:\eta_r\). Choose arbitrary bits \(T,q\), prescribe
\[
u_{u_r}+u_{v_r}=T+q+\eta_r,\quad
u_w=T+\sum_r(u_{u_r}+u_{v_r}),\quad
u_{p(w)}=T+q+\eta_w+u_w.
\tag{15}
\]
These prescriptions are compatible and determine a starting vertex up to free choices. Its total coordinate sum is \(T\). On the edge traversed in direction \(i\), (11), (14), and (15) give
\[
c_i(u^{S_i})=T+u_i+u_{p(i)}+\eta_i=q
\tag{16}
\]
for every direction. This gives a monochromatic antipodal geodesic. By the port-cycle switch identity, \(I(X)=2\), proving (5). A coloring achieving equality is supplied by any partner map of the specified form, proving sharpness. Since \(\mathfrak D\) is integral, (5) implies the strict improvement (6). \(\square\)

The deficit can also be localized to terminal sets of coordinate faces, yielding constraints on port cycles whose every minimum cocircuit has large intersection.

For \(i<j\), identify the four codimension-two faces perpendicular to \(i,j\) with \(Q_{[n]\setminus\{i,j\}}\). Let \(R_{ij}(X)\) be the union of projections of terminals of all face-spanning geodesics having at most two color changes, in all four faces. Here a face-path's changes are determined from \(d\) on its successive turns, so the set is independent of which complementary coloring is reconstructed. Let \(H_{ij}(X)=Q_{n-2}\setminus R_{ij}(X)\). Global antipodality pairs the four faces and preserves their change counts; hence both \(H_{ij}(X)\) and the square-defect set \(\mathfrak B_{ij}(X)\) are invariant under complementation of their projected coordinates. Let \(\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)\) be the quotient of \(H_{ij}(X)\) by this antipodal pairing.

**Theorem (terminal-hole obstruction for large port intersections).** If \(I(X)\ge6\), then
\[
\boxed{\mathfrak B_{ij}(X)\subseteq\mathfrak H_{ij}(X),}
\tag{17}
\]
and
\[
\boxed{\quad
\sum_{i<j}|\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)|
\ge(n+1)2^{n-4}+1,\qquad
\sum_{j\ne i}|\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)|\ge2^{n-3}
\quad(i\in[n]).}
\tag{18}
\]
Therefore
\[
\sum_{i<j}|\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)|\le(n+1)2^{n-4}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad I(X)\le4.
\tag{19}
\]

*Proof.* The condition \(I(X)\ge6\) means that every full antipodal geodesic has at least four changes. Consider a face-spanning geodesic \(P\) in one of the four \((n-2)\)-faces with at most two changes, ending at corner \(u\), whose projected terminal is \(z\). If \(P\) had at most one change, appending the two exterior directions would produce a full path with at most three changes, a contradiction. Thus \(P\) has two changes. Appending the two exterior directions in either order produces a full path with at most four changes, and therefore both new comparisons must be changes. If \(q\) is the last color of \(P\), both exterior edges incident with \(u\) have color \(1+q\), and the opposite two edges of their square have color \(q\). By (7), its two cross-derivatives are both one. Thus every projected terminal \(z\in R_{ij}(X)\) lies outside the square-defect set, yielding (17). Summing (17), then applying (4) and (6), proves (18). The final implication is the contrapositive of the first bound in (18). \(\square\)

All statistics in (3) and (17) use only the direction-labeled quotient, the incidence vector of \(X\), and marked partial geodesics. They impose local constraints on a port cycle whose minimum cocircuit intersections are all at least six.

Let \(n\ge3\), let \(\tau\) be cube antipodality, and put \(G=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), \(H=L(G)\). Fix an antipodally odd coloring \(c:E(Q_n)\to\mathbb F_2\). Its turn cochain \(d:E(H)\to\mathbb F_2\) assigns the difference of the colors of two incident cube edges. Put \(H_0=(V(H),\{t:d(t)=0\})\). Every turn of \(H\) has a unique center \(v\in V(G)\), and the turns centered at \(v\) form a clique \(K_v\cong K_n\).

Choose a lift \(x\) of \(v\), and partition the \(n\) cube edges incident with \(x\) into their color classes \(A_v^0,A_v^1\). Changing the lift interchanges these classes. Thus \(\lambda_v=|A_v^0||A_v^1|\) is well-defined. Write \(v\) *mixed* if \(\lambda_v>0\). All vertices of the turn clique corresponding to \(A_v^i\) belong to one connected component \(R_v^i\) of \(H_0\), because every turn inside a color class is a zero turn. The two components \(R_v^0,R_v^1\) may coincide.

Define a weighted multigraph \(\Gamma_c\) whose vertices are the connected components of \(H_0\). Each mixed \(v\) contributes one edge joining \(R_v^0\) and \(R_v^1\), of weight \(\lambda_v\), with loops allowed. Thus the \(\lambda_v\) different-color turns at one cube-vertex star form a single weighted edge bundle in \(\Gamma_c\).

**Theorem 1 (star-bundle rigidity).** Let \(b=\delta g\) be a binary cut cochain of \(H\) satisfying \(\operatorname{supp}(b)\subseteq\operatorname{supp}(d)\). Then, for every \(v\in V(G)\),
\[
\boxed{b|_{E(K_v)}=0\quad\text{or}\quad b|_{E(K_v)}=d|_{E(K_v)}.}\tag{1}
\]
Moreover, \(g\) descends to a binary vertex potential \(\bar g\) on \(\Gamma_c\). At a mixed \(v\), the second alternative of (1) holds if and only if \(\bar g(R_v^0)\ne\bar g(R_v^1)\). Conversely, any binary vertex potential on \(\Gamma_c\) determines a cut cochain of \(H\) supported on \(d\). Consequently,
\[
\boxed{|\operatorname{supp}(b)|=
\sum_{\substack{v\ \mathrm{mixed}\\\bar g(R_v^0)\ne\bar g(R_v^1)}}\lambda_v.}\tag{2}
\]
The support-minimizing cochains \(d'=d+b\) with \(\operatorname{supp}(d')\subseteq\operatorname{supp}(d)\) are therefore represented by maximum-weight cuts of \(\Gamma_c\).

*Proof.* The support inclusion forces \(b=0\) on \(H_0\); hence \(g\) is constant on every connected component of \(H_0\) and descends to \(\bar g\). At \(K_v\), it is constant on each of the two local color classes. If those constants agree then \(b\) vanishes on \(K_v\); if they differ then it is one precisely on turns between different color classes, which are the turns where \(d=1\). This proves (1). The converse follows by pulling any \(\bar g\) back to \(V(H)\); all zero turns then have equal endpoint values, so the pulled-back cut is supported on \(d\). The cliques \(K_v\) partition \(E(H)\), and a mixed clique has \(\lambda_v\) nonzero turns. This proves (2) and the weighted-cut statement. \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (a cut-resistant star bundle).** Every antipodally odd coloring \(c\) admits a mixed vertex \(v\in V(G)\) such that \(R_v^0=R_v^1\). In particular,
\[
\boxed{\lambda_v\ge n-1,\qquad
d'|_{E(K_v)}=d|_{E(K_v)}}
\tag{3}
\]
for every admissible support-decreasing switching \(d'=d+b\). Equivalently, \(\Gamma_c\) has a positive-weight loop, whose whole turn bundle survives every such switching.

*Proof.* By the Wu–Yang theorem on antipodal edge colorings, there is a monochromatic cube path \(P\) from some vertex \(x\) to \(\tau x\). Denote its successive edges by \(e_1,\ldots,e_m\). Their antipodal-pair vertices \([e_1],\ldots,[e_m]\) form a zero-turn path in \(H_0\), so \([e_1]\) and \([e_m]\) lie in the same component. At \(x\), the incident cube edges \(e_1\) and \(\tau e_m\) have opposite colors, while their vertices downstairs are \([e_1]\) and \([e_m]\). Hence the two color classes of the star centered at \([x]\) lie in the same \(H_0\)-component, making its bundle a loop. Since the star has two nonempty classes of cardinalities \(k,n-k\), its weight is \(k(n-k)\ge n-1\). Theorem 1 shows that cuts supported on \(d\) vanish on loops, so this bundle persists in every \(d'\). \(\square\)

**Proposition 3 (a sparse-cut zero-penalty criterion).** Every binary cut \(b\) of \(H\) satisfying
\[
\boxed{|\operatorname{supp}(b)|<(n-1)2^{n-1}}
\tag{4}
\]
is disjoint from some length-\(n\) monodromy-one simple cycle \(C\), corresponding to a full antipodal geodesic. Thus this conclusion applies to every supported cut of Theorem 1 whose crossing weight (2) satisfies (4).

*Proof.* The cube automorphism group acts transitively on turns and preserves the family \(\mathcal R_n\) of length-\(n\) monodromy-one cycles. Every such cycle has \(n\) turns, and \(|E(H)|=\binom n2 2^{n-1}\). Therefore for uniformly sampled \(C\in\mathcal R_n\),
\[
\mathbb E_C|\operatorname{supp}(b)\cap C|
=\frac{n|\operatorname{supp}(b)|}{|E(H)|}
=\frac{2|\operatorname{supp}(b)|}{(n-1)2^{n-1}}<2.
\]
Every graph cut meets every graph cycle in an even number of edges. Hence a nonnegative even-valued random variable with mean below two must attain zero. \(\square\)

The weighted quotient makes support deletion a cut problem on indivisible local switch bundles. Theorem 2 supplies a permanently retained bundle; Proposition 3 gives a checkable sufficient condition for a shortest port cocircuit to incur zero cut penalty.

**Sharpness of (4).** The constant in Proposition 3 cannot be increased for general graph cuts. Fix a coordinate \(s\), and define a vertex potential \(g\) on \(H\) by \(g([e])=1\) when the direction of the cube edge \(e\) is \(s\), and \(g([e])=0\) otherwise. For \(b=\delta g\), every star \(K_v\) contributes \(n-1\) turns to \(\operatorname{supp}(b)\). Since \(G\) has \(2^{n-1}\) vertices,
\[
|\operatorname{supp}(b)|=(n-1)2^{n-1}.
\]
Every length-\(n\) monodromy-one cycle visits every coordinate direction once, so precisely two of its turns cross between the direction-\(s\) vertex and the remaining directions. Thus
\[
|\operatorname{supp}(b)\cap C|=2
\]
for every \(C\in\mathcal R_n\).

### Direction-deleted cocircuit reassembly and rooted phase duality

Let \(m\ge2\), and let \(D_{m+1}\) be the pointed matroid built from the antipodal line-graph cover of \(Q_{m+1}\). Write
\[
I(X)=\min\{|X\cap Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_{m+1}),\ p\in Y,\ |Y|=m+2\}
\tag{1}
\]
for every port-containing binary cycle \(X\). Every such \(X\) is the turn support of an antipodally odd coloring of the edges of \(Q_{m+1}\), together with the port; the full-geodesic switch minimum is \(I(X)-2\).

Fix one coordinate direction \(s\), identify its zero facet with \(Q_m\), and write \(x^*\) for the antipode within that facet. An arbitrary undirected-edge coloring \(d_i(x)\), \(i\in[m]\), and a function \(h:Q_m\to\mathbb F_2\) satisfying
\[
h(x^*)=1+h(x)
\tag{2}
\]
determine the following antipodally odd coloring of \(Q_{m+1}\):
\[
c_i(x,0)=d_i(x),\qquad
c_i(x,1)=1+d_i(x^*),\quad (i\in[m]),
\qquad c_s(x,z)=h(x).
\tag{3}
\]
Conversely, every antipodally odd cube-edge coloring has this description relative to the selected coordinate. Denote its port-containing cycle by \(X(d,h)\). Geometrically, the direction-deleted turn subgraph is \(L(Q_m)\), a connected subgraph on which the covering monodromy vanishes. The function \(h\) specifies the remaining joining-edge phases.

For each full \(d\)-geodesic \(R\) within \(Q_m\), write \(r(R)\) for its number of color changes and \(s(R)\) for the color of its initial edge.

**Theorem 1 (reassembly formula for minimum port intersections).** For every \(d,h\) satisfying (2),
\[
\boxed{\begin{aligned}
I(X(d,h))=2+\min_{x\in Q_m}\ \min_{R:x\to x^*}\ \Theta(R,h(x)),\\
\Theta(R,p)=
\begin{cases}
r(R),&r(R)\text{ even},\\
r(R)-1+2[s(R)\ne p],&r(R)\text{ odd}.
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}}
\tag{4}
\]
Here every \(R\) spans all \(m\) directions, and both minimizations run over finite sets. The formula is independent of the other joining-edge colors \(h(y)\).

*Proof.* Any full geodesic of \(Q_{m+1}\) traverses the joining direction \(s\) once. Reverse it if needed so this step goes from facet zero to facet one, crossing at the lower-facet vertex \(x\). Reverse the lower portion of the geodesic and reverse the within-facet antipodal image of its upper portion. These two paths concatenate into a full \(d\)-geodesic \(R:x\to x^*\), uniquely split as \(R=UV\). Conversely, any such \(R\), split at any of its vertices, gives a full geodesic of (3), with color word
\[
\operatorname{rev}(w(U)),\quad p,\quad
\overline{\operatorname{rev}(w(V))},
\qquad p=h(x).
\tag{5}
\]
All directions appear once. Thus optimizing over full geodesics is equivalent to optimizing the two seams in (5) over \(R\), its split, and its root \(x\).

Put \(r=r(R)\), \(s=s(R)\), and \(q\) equal to the final color of \(R\). We have \(q=s+(r\bmod2)\) over \(\mathbb F_2\). If the split is interior, write \(j=1\) when it cuts a color change of \(R\), and \(j=0\) otherwise. The number of changes in (5) is
\[
r-j+[s\ne p]+[1+q\ne p].
\tag{6}
\]
If \(r\) is positive and even, the two seam indicators sum to one. Splitting at one of the \(r\) changes attains cost \(r\). If \(r=0\), an endpoint split places all \(m\) facet edges on whichever side gives their constant color agreement with \(p\), attaining cost zero. If \(r\) is odd, the seam indicators are equal and sum to \(2[s\ne p]\); splitting at a change attains \(r-1+2[s\ne p]\). An endpoint split has cost \(r+[s\ne p]\), never smaller. These are the values of \(\Theta\). Finally, the intersection identity \(I=\mu+2\) proves (4). \(\square\)

For an arbitrary coloring \(d\), define its allowable joining phases at \(x\) by
\[
\mathscr H_2(d,x)=
\{p\in\mathbb F_2:\min_{R:x\to x^*}\Theta(R,p)\le2\}.
\tag{7}
\]

**Lemma 2 (phase duality and an antipodal selection principle).** For every arbitrary \(d\),
\[
\boxed{\mathscr H_2(d,x^*)=1+\mathscr H_2(d,x).}
\tag{8}
\]
Furthermore, the following are equivalent:

(i) Every joining phase function \(h\) satisfying (2) gives \(I(X(d,h))\le4\).

(ii) Some \(x\in Q_m\) has \(\mathscr H_2(d,x)=\mathbb F_2\).

*Proof.* Reverse a rooted full \(d\)-geodesic \(R:x\to x^*\). The reversal has the same switch count; its first color is \(s(R)\) for even \(r(R)\), and \(1+s(R)\) for odd \(r(R)\). In either case (4) shows that replacing the root by \(x^*\) and the joining phase \(p\) by \(1+p\) preserves \(\Theta\). This proves (8).

If (ii) holds, every \(h\) assigns at that \(x\) a phase admitted by (7), and (4) supplies a port-cocircuit intersection at most four. Conversely, if no \(x\) admits both phases, choose one representative of each antipodal pair \(\{x,x^*\}\), select \(h(x)\) outside \(\mathscr H_2(d,x)\), and set \(h(x^*)=1+h(x)\). Equation (8) guarantees that both choices lie outside their respective allowable sets. The resulting \(h\) is antipodally odd and (4) gives \(I(X(d,h))>4\), contradicting (i). \(\square\)

**Theorem 3 (rooted criterion for universal short port-cocircuit intersections).** The following assertions are equivalent for every \(m\ge2\):

(a) Every binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_{m+1}\) containing the port satisfies \(I(X)\le4\).

(b) For every arbitrary undirected-edge coloring \(d\) of \(Q_m\), some vertex \(x\in Q_m\) has one of these properties: there is a full \(d\)-geodesic rooted at \(x\) with at most two changes; or there are two full \(d\)-geodesics rooted at \(x\), each with three changes, whose initial edge colors differ.

*Proof.* Formula (4) gives \(\mathscr H_2(d,x)=\mathbb F_2\) whenever a rooted geodesic has zero or two changes. When a rooted geodesic has one change, its two choices of \(p\) give costs zero and two; both are also allowable. If all rooted geodesics have at least three changes, then only those with precisely three changes and matching initial and joining colors have \(\Theta\le2\). Consequently \(\mathscr H_2(d,x)=\mathbb F_2\) holds precisely under the alternatives in (b). Every admissible port cycle is \(X(d,h)\) for some lower-facet coloring and joining function. Apply Lemma 2 and quantify over \(d\). \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (facet obstructions in a putative high-intersection cycle).** If \(X=X(d,h)\) satisfies \(I(X)\ge6\), then for every choice of the deleted direction and corresponding facet coloring \(d\):

1. No vertex of the facet starts a full \(d\)-geodesic with at most two changes.
2. Whenever a vertex \(x\) starts a full three-change \(d\)-geodesic, all such geodesics have the same initial color, necessarily \(1+h(x)\).
3. No vertex starts three-change \(d\)-geodesics with both initial colors.

*Proof.* If a path as in (1) existed, both joining phases at its root would produce an intersection at most four by (4). If a three-change path had initial color \(h(x)\), formula (4) would again produce an intersection four. Opposite initial phases among two such paths would include \(h(x)\), establishing (2)--(3). The deleted direction was arbitrary. \(\square\)

This characterization transfers the codimension-one reassembly theorem from Article X into the pointed matroid of Article XI. It couples a direction-deleted graphic restriction, an antipodally odd selection of joining phases, and minimum port-cocircuit intersections. The rooted criterion is unrestricted in the dimension, color dependence and choice of the deleted direction.

### Parallel-face port-cocircuit exchange at corresponding terminals

Let \(n\ge4\), \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and let \((D_n,p)\) be the pointed binary matroid of the antipodal turn covering. Fix a port-containing binary cycle \(X\) of \(D_n\), let \(d_X(t)=\mathbf1_{\{t\in X\}}\) for turns \(t\in E(H_n)\), and put
\[
I(X)=\min\{|X\cap Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(D_n),\ p\in Y,\ |Y|=n+1\}.
\tag{1}
\]
For a direction-distinct cube path \(P=(e_1,\ldots,e_m)\), define the integer turn weight
\[
r_X(P)=\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}d_X(\{[e_j],[e_{j+1}]\}).
\tag{2}
\]
It equals the number of edge-color changes in \(P\) for either cube coloring recovered from \(X\). The pointed matroid formula says that the minimum switch count over all full antipodal geodesics is \(I(X)-2\). In particular, \(I(X)\) is even.

**Theorem (parallel-face intersection bound).** Fix two directions \(a,b\), a codimension-two face \(F\) in which their coordinates are fixed, and the neighboring face \(F^a\). Suppose \(P\subset F\) and \(Q\subset F^a\) span their faces and terminate at corresponding vertices \(x,x^a\). Write \(r=r_X(P)\) and \(s=r_X(Q)\). Then
\[
\boxed{
I(X)\le2+
\min\left\{
\max\bigl(r,2\lceil s/2\rceil\bigr),\
\max\bigl(s,2\lceil r/2\rceil\bigr)
\right\}.}
\tag{3}
\]
Consequently, a monochromatic face-spanning path matched to a path of at most one change in the adjacent face forces \(I(X)=2\). Two matched face-spanning paths with at most two changes each force \(I(X)\le4\).

*Proof.* Recover an antipodally odd cube-edge coloring \(c\) from \(X\). Write \(\rho,\sigma\) for the final colors of \(P,Q\), respectively. Label the four edges of the exterior square at their terminals:
\[
A=c(xx^a),\quad B=c(xx^b),\quad
C=c(x^ax^{ab}),\quad D=c(x^bx^{ab}).
\tag{4}
\]
Completing either face path by the two possible exterior square routes gives four full antipodal geodesics with respective switch counts
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
r+[\rho\ne A]+[A\ne C],&
r+[\rho\ne B]+[B\ne D],\\
s+[\sigma\ne A]+[A\ne B],&
s+[\sigma\ne C]+[C\ne D].
\end{array}
\tag{5}
\]
For every rooted full geodesic with \(z\) changes, cyclic rotation of the root gives another full geodesic with at most \(2\lfloor z/2\rfloor\) changes. Indeed, when \(z\) is odd, the closing antipodal comparison has value zero, and cutting the cyclic turn word at a changed comparison removes one switch. Thus any bound for a completion in (5) yields the corresponding even bound on \(I(X)-2\).

First prove
\[
I(X)-2\le M:=\max\{r,2\lceil s/2\rceil\}.
\tag{6}
\]
If \(r\) is even and \(M\ge r+2\), either completion of \(P\) has at most \(r+2\le M\) changes. If \(r\) is odd and \(M\ge r+1\), either completion has at most \(r+2\) changes, which is odd; cyclic reduction gives at most \(r+1\le M\). It remains to consider \(M=r\).

If \(r\) is even and both completions of \(P\) failed to yield at most \(r\) after cyclic reduction, each would introduce two new switches. Their square-edge constraints are
\[
A=B=1+\rho,\qquad C=D=\rho.
\tag{7}
\]
One of the two completing routes for \(Q\) then has both edges of color \(\sigma\), so it gives a full geodesic with at most \(s\le2\lceil s/2\rceil\le r\) changes, a contradiction.

If \(r\) is odd, \(2\lceil s/2\rceil\le r-1\). When \(s\le r-2\), any completion of \(Q\) has at most \(s+2\le r\) changes; cyclic reduction gives at most \(r-1\). The remaining case is \(s=r-1\), with \(s\) even. If both completions of \(Q\) failed to yield at most \(r-1\), they would both introduce two switches, forcing
\[
A=C=1+\sigma,\qquad B=D=\sigma.
\tag{8}
\]
One of the two routes completing \(P\) then consists of edges of color \(\rho\), producing \(r\) switches and hence at most \(r-1\) after cyclic reduction, again a contradiction.

This proves (6). Interchanging \(F\) and \(F^a\) proves
\(I(X)-2\le\max\{s,2\lceil r/2\rceil\}\). Taking the smaller bound proves (3). Substituting \((r,s)=(0,0),(0,1)\), or \(r,s\le2\), proves the consequences. \(\square\)

The theorem uses two marked face paths with **corresponding terminal vertices**, an additional geometric condition on top of their individual turn weights. It adds an inter-face intersection certificate to the single-face completion and exterior-star rigidity theorems. Both paths, their turns, and the matching of their terminals can be read from the direction-labeled cube covering, while their switch counts are simply incidences with the port cycle \(X\).

### Equivariant square-derivative galleries for arbitrary port cycles

Let \(n\ge3\), let \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and let \((D_n,p)\) be the pointed binary matroid defined by the antipodal turn cover. Fix any binary cycle \(X\in Z(D_n)\) containing the port \(p\), and write \(d_X\) for its indicator on turns. At a cube vertex \(x\), write \(d^X_{ij}([x])\) for the label of the turn between the edges in directions \(i,j\). For \(i\ne j\), define the square derivative
\[
\partial_j^X(i;x)=d^X_{ij}([x])+d^X_{ij}([x^j])\in\mathbb F_2.
\tag{1}
\]
The star-triangle and square identities for a port cycle make (1) a function of its undirected \((i,j)\)-square, constant on antipodal square pairs. If \(c\) is either reconstructed antipodally odd cube-edge coloring, then
\[
\partial_j^X(i;x)=c_i(x)+c_i(x^j).
\tag{2}
\]
Thus all derivative conditions below are intrinsically determined by \(X\).

Let \(\mathcal T_n\) be the antipodally invariant Freudenthal triangulation of the boundary of the \(n\)-cube. Its maximal simplices are monotone vertex chains through an \((n-1)\)-dimensional coordinate facet, corresponding to geodesics traversing all directions but the fixed one. Write \(\tau\) for complementation of cube vertices.

Fix a family
\[
\mathcal A=((i_\alpha,S_\alpha))_{\alpha=1}^r,
\qquad i_\alpha\in[n],\quad
S_\alpha\subseteq[n]\setminus\{i_\alpha\},\quad
|S_\alpha|\equiv0\pmod2,
\tag{3}
\]
where directions may repeat. Call a maximal simplex of \(\mathcal T_n\) a witness for \(\mathcal A\) if its facet geodesic contains, for each \(\alpha\), a step in some direction \(j\ne i_\alpha\) crossing an \((i_\alpha,j)\)-square with
\[
\partial_j^X(i_\alpha;x)\ne\mathbf1_{\{j\in S_\alpha\}}.
\tag{4}
\]
Let \(\mathcal G_{\mathcal A}(X)\) be the adjacency graph of witnessing maximal simplices, joined when they share a codimension-one simplex. Its vertices and adjacency depend only on \(X\) and the indexed constraints.

**Theorem (simultaneous port-derivative witnesses and invariant galleries).** For every \(X\) and every family (3):

(i) If \(r\le n-1\), the graph \(\mathcal G_{\mathcal A}(X)\) is nonempty.

(ii) If \(r\le n-2\), the graph contains a connected component invariant under \(\tau\).

The bound \(r\le n-2\) for invariant connectedness is sharp in every dimension.

*Proof.* Recover a cube-edge coloring \(c\) from \(X\) and define at every vertex \(x\)
\[
g_\alpha(x)=(-1)^{\,c_{i_\alpha}(x)+\sum_{j\in S_\alpha}x_j}.
\tag{5}
\]
Every \(|S_\alpha|\) is even, and \(c_{i_\alpha}\) is antipodally odd, so \(g_\alpha(\bar x)=-g_\alpha(x)\). Changing the reconstructed coloring by complementation changes all \(g_\alpha\) by a global sign; their zero sets and sign-mixed simplices are unaffected. Moreover \(g_\alpha(x^{i_\alpha})=g_\alpha(x)\), and on a direction-\(j\) edge the sign changes precisely when (4) holds, by (2).

Extend the sign vector \(g=(g_1,\ldots,g_r)\) affinely on every simplex of \(\mathcal T_n\). This produces an odd continuous piecewise-linear map
\[
G:|\mathcal T_n|\cong S^{n-1}\longrightarrow\mathbb R^r.
\tag{6}
\]
If \(r\le n-1\), the Borsuk–Ulam theorem gives a zero of \(G\). The smallest simplex containing that zero has both signs in each coordinate, because zero is a convex combination of its vertex sign vectors. Its containing maximal simplex is therefore a witness for every constraint: along its vertex chain the sign of each \(g_\alpha\) changes on some edge, and such a step has direction different from \(i_\alpha\). This proves (i).

For (ii), we first prove a connected-zero-set principle. If \(F:S^d\to\mathbb R^r\) is an odd piecewise-linear map with \(r\le d-1\), some connected component of \(F^{-1}(0)\) is invariant under the antipodal map. Indeed, its zero set is a finite polyhedron, hence has finitely many connected components. If every component were exchanged with another, assign signs \(+1,-1\) to the paired components, obtaining an odd continuous function \(h:F^{-1}(0)\to\{-1,1\}\). Extend \(h\) continuously to the sphere and antisymmetrize its extension to get an odd function \(H\) that remains \(h\) on the zero set. The odd map \((F,H):S^d\to\mathbb R^{r+1}\) would be nowhere zero, contradicting Borsuk–Ulam because \(r+1\le d\).

Apply this principle to (6), with \(d=n-1\). Let \(Z_0\subseteq G^{-1}(0)\) be a connected \(\tau\)-invariant component. Every maximal simplex meeting \(Z_0\) is a witness, as above. The finite family of their closed intersections with \(Z_0\) covers \(Z_0\) and has connected intersection graph. When two maximal simplices share a zero \(z\), both contain the smallest simplex \(\rho\) containing \(z\). The maximal simplices containing \(\rho\) form a ridge-connected gallery in the triangulated sphere. Every intermediate ridge contains \(\rho\) and hence has both signs in each coordinate; all adjacent maximal simplices are witnesses. Thus all maximal simplices meeting \(Z_0\) belong to one connected component of \(\mathcal G_{\mathcal A}(X)\). Since this collection is invariant under \(\tau\), that component is invariant.

For sharpness, define the antipodally odd edge coloring
\[
c_i(x)=x_{i+1}\quad(i<n),\qquad c_n(x)=x_1.
\tag{7}
\]
Choose \(r=n-1\), with \((i_\alpha,S_\alpha)=(\alpha,\varnothing)\) for \(1\le\alpha<n\). Each constraint is met only by crossing direction \(i_\alpha+1\), so a witnessing facet chain must traverse all directions \(2,\ldots,n\). It therefore lies in one of the two opposite facets \(x_1=0\) or \(x_1=1\). These families have no adjacent maximal simplices, and \(\tau\) exchanges them. The coloring corresponds to a port cycle \(X\), so the threshold is sharp within the pointed-matroid class. \(\square\)

**Corollary (connected derivative-defect galleries under a large port intersection).** Suppose \(n\ge5\) is odd, \(I(X)\ge6\), and \(I\subseteq[n]\) is nonempty with \(|I|\le n-2\). There is a connected \(\tau\)-invariant gallery of facet-spanning geodesics such that for every path in the gallery, and every \(i\in I\), some step in direction \(j\ne i\) crosses a square with
\[
\partial_j^X(i;x)=0
\tag{8}
\]
whose projected corner lies in the terminal-hole set \(\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)\) defined by the codimension-two face-terminal condition.

*Proof.* For each \(i\in I\), use the mask \(S_i=[n]\setminus\{i\}\), whose size \(n-1\) is even. Equation (4) then becomes (8), and the theorem gives the invariant connected gallery. The terminal-hole inclusion for a port cycle with \(I(X)\ge6\) states that a square with derivative zero cannot project to a terminal of a face-spanning path with at most two changes: such a terminal would force both square derivatives to be one. Therefore each square in (8) projects into \(\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)\). \(\square\)

**Corollary (simultaneous opposite derivative values).** If \(n\ge5\) is odd and \(I\subseteq[n]\) satisfies \(2|I|\le n-2\), there is a connected, antipodally invariant gallery of facet-spanning geodesics such that every path in the gallery crosses, for every \(i\in I\), one square with \(\partial_j^X(i)=0\) and another (possibly involving a different direction) with \(\partial_k^X(i)=1\).

*Proof.* For each \(i\in I\), impose both masks \(S=\varnothing\) and \(S=[n]\setminus\{i\}\). They are even, and their requirements (4) force the derivative values one and zero, respectively. Apply the theorem with \(r=2|I|\). \(\square\)

These assertions give a dimension-independent, equivariant connectivity constraint on every port cycle, in addition to the numerical intersection and defect bounds. The gallery witnesses local square derivatives and retains the full facet-path flags. The existence of a minimum port cocircuit with small intersection remains an additional global extraction problem.

### Lifted phase transport and two-intersection splicing certificates

Let \(n\ge4\), \(G_n=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), and \(H_n=L(G_n)\). Let \(X\) be a binary cycle of the pointed matroid \(D_n\) containing \(p\), with turn label \(d=\mathbf1_{X\setminus\{p\}}\). By the monodromy condition, the pullback of \(d\) to the connected graph \(L(Q_n)\) is a coboundary.

For two undirected cube edges \(e,f\), choose any turn path \(\gamma\) from \(e\) to \(f\) in \(L(Q_n)\) and put
\[
\rho_X(e,f)=\sum_{t\in\gamma}d([t])\pmod2.
\tag{1}
\]
Here \([t]\) denotes projection of a cube turn to \(H_n\). The result is independent of \(\gamma\), because every closed turn walk in \(L(Q_n)\) has zero pulled-back \(d\)-sum. Equivalently, if \(c\) is any recovered antipodally odd cube-edge coloring, then
\[
\boxed{\rho_X(e,f)=c(e)+c(f)\pmod2.}
\tag{2}
\]
In particular, \(\rho_X(e,\tau e)=1\), and for incident cube edges \(\rho_X(e,f)\) is their turn label \(d\). Thus \(\rho_X\) expresses relative color phases using the pointed-matroid cycle \(X\), independently of the global color complement.

For a cube geodesic \(P\), let \(A(P)\subseteq E(H_n)\) denote the projected consecutive turns, so that \(|A(P)\cap X|\) is its number of switches. Its edge-color phase on a monochromatic subpath can be compared to another such path by \(\rho_X\) between any one edge of each subpath.

**Lemma 1 (one missing direction).** If a cube geodesic traverses \(n-1\) distinct directions and all its edge turns lie outside \(X\), then some full antipodal cube geodesic has all its turn edges outside \(X\). Equivalently, the minimum shortest-port-cocircuit intersection \(I(X)\) equals two.

*Proof.* Let the \((n-1)\)-edge path run from \(u\) to \(v=\tau u^{\,b}\), missing direction \(b\), and have constant color \(s\). The \(b\)-edges at \(u\) and \(v\) are antipodal and therefore have complementary colors. One has color \(s\). Append it at \(v\) or prepend it at \(u\), choosing the endpoint where agreement occurs; the result is a monochromatic full antipodal geodesic. Its projected turn cycle has one labeled turn, hence its port cocircuit meets \(X\) in two elements. Every port intersection is a positive even integer, so this is minimal. \(\square\)

Fix distinct exterior directions \(a,b\), let \(D=[n]\setminus\{a,b\}\), and let \(F,F^a\) be adjacent \((n-2)\)-faces. For any \(u,x\in F\), let \(u^a,x^a\in F^a\) be the corresponding vertices.

**Theorem 2 (opposite-phase aligned switch certificate).** Suppose \(P\subset F\) and \(Q\subset F^a\) are geodesics spanning their faces, from \(u\) to \(x\) and from \(u^a\) to \(x^a\). Suppose both have precisely one turn in \(X\), at respective vertices \(z\in P\) and \(z^a\in Q\), and the sets \(A,B\) of directions used before and after these switch vertices agree between the two paths. Each set is nonempty; their internal orders may differ. If \(e_P,e_Q\) are their initial edges and
\[
\boxed{\rho_X(e_P,e_Q)=1,}
\tag{3}
\]
then
\[
\boxed{I(X)=2.}
\tag{4}
\]

*Proof.* Recover a coloring \(c\), and write \(s=c(e_P)\). Since \(P,Q\) each have one switch and (3) holds, their two blocks have colors
\[
P:\quad s^{|A|}(1+s)^{|B|},
\qquad
Q:\quad (1+s)^{|A|}s^{|B|}.
\tag{5}
\]
Let \(h=c(zz^a)\). If \(h=s\), the concatenation of the \(A\)-prefix of \(P\), the \(a\)-edge \(zz^a\), and the \(B\)-suffix of \(Q\) is a monochromatic geodesic from \(u\) to \(x^a\). If \(h=1+s\), concatenate the \(A\)-prefix of \(Q\), the reverse \(a\)-edge \(z^az\), and the \(B\)-suffix of \(P\), producing a monochromatic geodesic from \(u^a\) to \(x\). In either case the path uses every direction in \(D\cup\{a\}\) once and omits only \(b\). Apply Lemma 1. \(\square\)

The next certificate needs only monochromatic arms and the geometry of their meeting vertices.

**Theorem 3 (two-arm interface transport).** Let \(P\subset F\) and \(Q\subset F^a\) be spanning geodesics with corresponding initial and terminal vertices as above. Suppose \(w\) is an interior vertex of \(P\), and \(w^a\) is an interior vertex of \(Q\). The following implications hold.

(i) If the prefix \(P[u,w]\) and the suffix \(Q[w^a,x^a]\) have no turns in \(X\), and one edge \(e\) of the first and one edge \(f\) of the second satisfy \(\rho_X(e,f)=0\), then either \(I(X)=2\), or
\[
\boxed{\rho_X(e,ww^a)=1.}
\tag{6}
\]

(ii) If the prefix \(Q[u^a,w^a]\) and suffix \(P[w,x]\) have no turns in \(X\), and their chosen edges \(e',f'\) satisfy \(\rho_X(e',f')=0\), then either \(I(X)=2\), or
\[
\boxed{\rho_X(e',ww^a)=1.}
\tag{7}
\]

If both (i) and (ii) hold and \(\rho_X(e,e')=1\), then \(I(X)=2\).

*Proof.* The coordinate sets traversed by \(P[u,w]\) and \(Q[w^a,x^a]\) are disjoint and cover \(D\), because the two paths have corresponding start and end vertices, and the intermediate vertices are related by the \(a\)-translation. Under the first two hypotheses of (i), these arms have the same constant edge color, say \(s\). If the connecting \(a\)-edge \(ww^a\) had color \(s\), their concatenation would be a monochromatic geodesic using \(D\cup\{a\}\), and Lemma 1 would give \(I(X)=2\). If \(I(X)>2\), the joining edge must have color \(1+s\), which is (6) by (2).

The same argument, interchanging \(P,Q\), proves (ii). If both conclusions were required while \(\rho_X(e,e')=1\), the single joining \(a\)-edge would have to be opposite in color to two edges of opposite colors. This is impossible, so \(I(X)=2\). \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (phase coherence in a high-intersection cycle).** Assume \(I(X)\ge4\). Two one-turn spanning geodesics on adjacent codimension-two faces with corresponding starting vertices, terminal vertices and switch vertices cannot have opposite initial phases. Likewise, any pair of interface configurations of Theorem 3 whose two monochromatic phases disagree cannot coexist at the same projected vertex.

*Proof.* The first assertion is the contrapositive of Theorem 2. The second is the last assertion of Theorem 3. \(\square\)

The transport \(\rho_X\) is a cocycle primitive on the lifted line graph. It expresses the phase information needed in the adjacent-face splicing theorems of Article VIII directly through the binary cycle \(X\). Theorems 2--3 give checkable geometric certificates forcing a shortest port cocircuit \(Y\) with \(|X\cap Y|=2\), the monochromatic intersection target.

### Reversal-odd boundary tournaments as pointed turn matroids

Let \(V\) be a set of \(n\ge5\) vertices. An ordinary boundary 3-tournament is a function
\[
b:V_{\neq}^{3}\longrightarrow\mathbb F_2,\qquad
b(c,b_0,a)=1+b(a,b_0,c),
\tag{1}
\]
where \(V_{\neq}^{3}\) is the set of triples with pairwise distinct entries; \(b_0\) denotes the middle entry, to distinguish it from the function \(b\). The long-path witness is an injective word \(v_1,\ldots,v_m\) for which all \(m-2\) triple values \(b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\) agree.

**Proposition 1 (line-graph orientation).** Boundary 3-tournaments on \(V\) are in bijection with orientations of the ordinary line graph \(L(K_V)\). The edge between \(\{a,b_0\}\) and \(\{b_0,c\}\) is directed from the former to the latter precisely when \(b(a,b_0,c)=0\). A positive tight path corresponds to a directed walk through the successive vertices
\[
\{v_1,v_2\},\{v_2,v_3\},\ldots,\{v_{m-1},v_m\}
\tag{2}
\]
of \(L(K_V)\), with consecutive incidences alternating endpoints of their common \(K_V\)-edge and with the symbols \(v_i\) pairwise distinct.

*Proof.* Every edge of \(L(K_V)\) has a unique middle vertex \(b_0\) of \(K_V\), and is represented by a reversal pair \((a,b_0,c),(c,b_0,a)\). Equation (1) chooses one of the two orientations. Conversely every orientation makes this choice and defines the reversal-odd function. In (2), consecutive edges of \(L(K_V)\) represent the triples \((v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\). A zero value means the traversal follows the prescribed orientation. The incidence and injectivity conditions are precisely the conditions that this walk comes from an injective word of original vertices. \(\square\)

Define the **triple-overlap graph** \(\widetilde T_V\) to have vertex set \(V_{\neq}^3\), with an undirected edge between
\[
(a,b_0,c)\quad\text{and}\quad(b_0,c,d)
\tag{3}
\]
whenever \(a,b_0,c,d\) are pairwise distinct. Reversal \(J(a,b_0,c)=(c,b_0,a)\) is a fixed-point-free involution of \(\widetilde T_V\), and it maps the edge in (3) to the edge between \((d,c,b_0)\) and \((c,b_0,a)\). Put
\[
T_V=\widetilde T_V/\langle J\rangle,\qquad
\pi:\widetilde T_V\longrightarrow T_V.
\tag{4}
\]

**Lemma 2 (connected double cover).** For \(n\ge5\), \(\widetilde T_V\) and \(T_V\) are connected, and \(\pi\) is a regular two-sheeted graph covering. Their orders are
\[
|V(T_V)|=\frac{(n)_3}{2},\qquad
|E(T_V)|=\frac{(n)_4}{2},\qquad
\deg_{T_V}(x)=2(n-3),
\tag{5}
\]
where \((n)_r=n(n-1)\cdots(n-r+1)\).

*Proof.* A triple \((a,b_0,c)\) has \(n-3\) neighbors of the form \((b_0,c,d)\) and \(n-3\) of the form \((d,a,b_0)\). These are distinct, and no pair consists of reversals of one another: the middle two symbols of the starting triple are distinct. Thus the free involution also acts freely on edges and gives a graph covering; counting vertices and edges gives (5).

For connectivity, fix the middle symbol \(b_0\). Any first entry \(a\) can be changed to \(e\notin\{b_0,c\}\) through
\[
(a,b_0,c)\ --\ (b_0,c,d)\ --\ (e,b_0,c),
\tag{6}
\]
choosing \(d\notin\{a,b_0,c,e\}\), possible because \(n\ge5\). A symmetrical two-step walk changes the last entry while fixing the first and middle entries. These operations connect all ordered triples having the same middle symbol: the graph of ordered pairs of distinct elements of \(V\setminus\{b_0\}\), with changes of one entry, is connected. Finally (3) changes the middle symbol from \(b_0\) to any chosen \(c\ne b_0\) by selecting \(a,d\) distinct from the two. Hence \(\widetilde T_V\) is connected. \(\square\)

Let \(\alpha:Z_1(T_V;\mathbb F_2)\to\mathbb F_2\) denote the covering-monodromy functional: a closed walk has \(\alpha=0\) when its lift closes, and \(\alpha=1\) when its lift ends at the reversed triple. Choose any binary edge cochain \(a\in C^1(T_V;\mathbb F_2)\) representing \(\alpha\). Let \(B\) be the binary vertex-edge incidence matrix of \(T_V\), and introduce a distinguished element \(p\). Set
\[
\widehat A_V=
\begin{pmatrix}B&0\\a&1\end{pmatrix},
\qquad D_V^{\mathrm{BT}}=M(\widehat A_V)^*.
\tag{7}
\]
The pointed binary matroid depends only on \(V\) and the overlap/reversal structure, independently of a tournament coloring.

**Theorem 3 (boundary tournament–port-cycle correspondence).** A boundary tournament \(b\) defines a turn cochain on \(T_V\) by
\[
d_b(\pi\{t,s\})=b(t)+b(s).
\tag{8}
\]
It obeys
\[
\boxed{d_b=a+\delta f,\qquad f\in C^0(T_V;\mathbb F_2),}
\tag{9}
\]
and the binary cycles of \(D_V^{\mathrm{BT}}\) containing \(p\) are precisely
\[
\boxed{X_b=\operatorname{supp}(d_b)\cup\{p\}.}
\tag{10}
\]
Every port-containing binary cycle of \(D_V^{\mathrm{BT}}\) is of this form. The two boundary tournaments inducing a given port cycle are complementary: \(b\) and \(1+b\). Furthermore,
\[
\boxed{
\mathcal C^*(D_V^{\mathrm{BT}})\cap\{Y:p\in Y\}
=\{\,C\cup\{p\}: C\subseteq T_V\text{ a simple cycle with }\alpha(C)=1\,\}.
}
\tag{11}
\]
For such a cocircuit and a port cycle,
\[
\boxed{|X_b\cap(C\cup\{p\})|=1+|\operatorname{supp}(d_b)\cap C|
\quad\text{is a positive even integer}.}
\tag{12}
\]

*Proof.* Because \(b(Jt)=b(t)+1\), the sum \(b(t)+b(s)\) is unchanged on applying \(J\) to an overlap edge, so (8) is well-defined. Lift a closed walk \(C\) of \(T_V\), starting at \(t\). Telescoping (8) along the lift gives \(d_b(C)=b(t)+b(J^{\alpha(C)}t)=\alpha(C)\). Since \(a\) represents the same functional on cycles, \(d_b+a\) annihilates every graphic cycle. The cut-cycle orthogonality of a connected graph implies \(d_b+a=\delta f\).

Conversely any cochain \(d=a+\delta f\) pulls back to a coboundary on the connected graph \(\widetilde T_V\), since its sum on every lifted closed cycle vanishes. Integrate from one triple \(t_0\) to obtain \(b\). Because the covering involution preserves the pullback cochain, \(b(Jt)+b(t)\) is constant on the connected covering graph; evaluating on an odd-monodromy lifted walk gives the constant one. Thus (1) holds. The integration is unique up to a global constant, producing the two complementary colorings.

The row space of (7) is the binary cycle space of its dual and consists of \((\delta f,0)\) and \((a+\delta f,1)\), proving (10). A port-containing circuit of \(M(\widehat A_V)\), equivalently a port-containing cocircuit of \(D_V^{\mathrm{BT}}\), has a graphic Eulerian part with monodromy one. Its minimality forces this part to be a single simple odd-monodromy cycle, proving (11). Finally \(d_b(C)=\alpha(C)=1\), so its integer support weight on \(C\) is odd; adjoining the common port proves (12). \(\square\)

Since \(|V(T_V)|=(n)_3/2\) and \(|E(T_V)|=(n)_4/2\), the dual matroid has rank
\[
\operatorname{rank}D_V^{\mathrm{BT}}
=\frac{(n)_4-(n)_3}{2}+1.
\tag{13}
\]

**Theorem 4 (tight-path decoding).** Let \(3\le m\le n\). For an injective word \(v=(v_1,\ldots,v_m)\), define the forward overlap path \(\gamma_v\) in \(\widetilde T_V\) through
\[
t_i=(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2}),\qquad 1\le i\le m-2,
\tag{14}
\]
and let \(\pi\gamma_v\) denote its projected path in \(T_V\). Then
\[
\boxed{
\sum_{i=1}^{m-3}
[b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\ne b(v_{i+1},v_{i+2},v_{i+3})]
=|\operatorname{supp}(d_b)\cap E(\pi\gamma_v)|.
}
\tag{15}
\]
Consequently \(b\) has a vertex-simple monochromatic tight path on \(m\) original vertices if and only if
\[
\boxed{
\min_{\substack{v_1,\ldots,v_m\in V\\\text{pairwise distinct}}}
|X_b\cap E(\pi\gamma_v)|=0.
}
\tag{16}
\]
The same condition characterizes the existence of a positive tight path, since reversing an injective word complements and reverses its color word.

*Proof.* Each edge of \(\gamma_v\) is the overlap of the consecutive triples in (14). By (8), it is labeled one precisely when their colors differ. Pairwise distinct symbols imply that the projected vertices and edges of \(\gamma_v\) are not repeated, so the right side of (15) counts each transition once. Vanishing means the triple-color word is constant, proving (16). The reversal identity (1) changes a constant-one word into a constant-zero word. \(\square\)

**Proposition 5 (bounded odd-girth).** For every \(n\ge5\), the least size of a port-containing cocircuit of \(D_V^{\mathrm{BT}}\) is seven. Equivalently, the least length of a cycle of \(T_V\) with monodromy one is six.

*Proof.* Choose five distinct symbols \(a,b_0,c,d,e\). The following is a six-edge path in \(\widetilde T_V\):
\[
\begin{split}
(a,b_0,c)&\;--\;(b_0,c,e)\;--\;(d,b_0,c)\;--\;(e,d,b_0)\\
&\;--\;(d,b_0,a)\;--\;(b_0,a,e)\;--\;(c,b_0,a).
\end{split}
\tag{17}
\]
Its endpoints are reversals, and its six intermediate reversal-orbits are distinct. Its projection is therefore a simple six-cycle with monodromy one.

To verify minimality uniformly in \(n\), a path of length at most five from a triple to its reverse uses at most eight symbols: each overlap step retains two existing symbols and introduces at most one. Relabel those symbols into \(\{0,\ldots,7\}\). It is enough to verify in the graph on the \(336\) ordered triples of eight symbols that \((2,1,0)\) lies outside the radius-five ball around \((0,1,2)\). The following exhaustive finite check uses precisely the adjacency definition (3):
\[
\begin{array}{l}
R=\{(0,1,2)\};\\
\text{repeat five times: }\;
R\leftarrow R\cup\bigcup_{(a,b_0,c)\in R}
\{(b_0,c,d),(d,a,b_0):d\notin\{a,b_0,c\}\};\\
(2,1,0)\notin R.
\end{array}
\tag{18}
\]
For reproducibility, the respective distance-layer cardinalities through radius five are \(1,10,55,162,97,10\); a sixth step reaches the reversed triple. This computation covers every possible path of length at most five in any order \(n\), because of the eight-symbol cutoff. Thus the least odd-monodromy cycle has length six, and (11) gives cocircuit size seven. \(\square\)

**Witness distinction.** In the cube case of Article XI, shortest odd-monodromy cycles themselves encode full antipodal geodesics. In the boundary-tournament matroid, port cocircuits of size seven exist uniformly in \(n\), while the long-path target in (16) is a *forward*, symbol-injective overlap path that need not be closed. Accordingly (16) is the pertinent cycle–path zero-intersection problem; the short port cocircuits of (11) encode local reversal monodromy and do not themselves encode long tight paths. This distinction also records both endpoint-seam constraints implicitly in the ordered overlap path: concatenations must preserve directed pair overlaps and the injectivity of the underlying word.

## Matroid Generalizations and Short-Port Intersection Conjectures

Let \(M\) be a finite binary matroid and let \(p\in E(M)\) belong to a circuit and a cocircuit. Define the **port cogirth**
\[
g_p(M)=\min\{|Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(M),\ p\in Y\},
\]
where \(Z(M)\) denotes the binary cycle space. For an even positive integer \(b\), define the **short-port intersection property** \(P_b(M,p)\) by
\[
\boxed{\forall X\in Z(M)\ (p\in X),\quad
\exists Y\in\mathcal C^*(M):
p\in Y,\ |Y|=g_p(M),\ |X\cap Y|\le b.}\tag{1}
\]
Cycle–cocircuit orthogonality over \(\mathbb F_2\) forces every intersection in (1) to have positive even cardinality.

In Article XI's pointed dual \(D_n\), shortest port cocircuits are the cyclic turn encodings of antipodal geodesics, and every port-containing binary cycle encodes an antipodally odd cube-edge coloring. Thus \(P_4(D_n,p)\) is equivalent to the unrestricted two-switch conjecture, while \(P_2(D_n,p)\) is equivalent to monochromatic NORI1.

**Proposition 1 (small port cogirth).** Every pointed binary matroid with \(g_p(M)\le5\) has \(P_4\). Every pointed binary matroid with \(g_p(M)\le3\) has \(P_2\).

*Proof.* Fix any shortest port cocircuit \(Y\). For every binary cycle \(X\ni p\), the intersection \(X\cap Y\) is nonempty, even, and of size at most \(g_p(M)\). The asserted bounds follow. \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (port-cogirth-preserving contraction inheritance).** Let \(T\subseteq E(M)\setminus\{p\}\), put \(M_0=M/T\), and assume
\[
g_p(M)=g_p(M_0).\tag{2}
\]
For any positive even \(b\), if \(P_b(M_0,p)\) holds, then \(P_b(M,p)\) holds.

*Proof.* Write \(S=E(M)\setminus T\). Take any binary cycle \(X\in Z(M)\) with \(p\in X\). The restriction \(X_0=X\cap S\) is a binary cycle of \(M/T\), and \(p\in X_0\). Choose by \(P_b(M_0,p)\) a cocircuit \(Y\ni p\) of \(M_0\) satisfying \(|Y|=g_p(M_0)\) and \(|X_0\cap Y|\le b\). Cocircuits of \(M/T\) are precisely the cocircuits of \(M\) disjoint from \(T\). Hence \(Y\) is a cocircuit of \(M\), and (2) makes it shortest among those containing \(p\). Finally \(Y\subseteq S\) gives
\[
|X\cap Y|=|X_0\cap Y|\le b.
\]
\(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (cubical contraction class).** Suppose a pointed binary matroid \(M\) has a contraction \(M/T\cong D_n\), with \(p\notin T\), and \(g_p(M)=n+1\). Then \(P_b(D_n,p)\) implies \(P_b(M,p)\). For \(b=2,4\), the universal \(P_b\) assertion over all such matroids and all \(n\ge3\) is equivalent to the respective cube conjecture, since the class includes \(M=D_n\) with \(T=\varnothing\).

The theorem applies without restrictions on the number of elements, representational rank, or other circuits of \(M\). The port cogirth equality is essential to lifting a *minimum-size* cocircuit from the contraction.

Let \((N,t)\) be a simple binary matroid represented by pairwise distinct nonzero vectors \(S\cup\{t\}\subseteq V=\mathbb F_2^r\), with \(t\) in the span of \(S\). Let
\[
q=\min\{|C|:C\text{ a circuit of }N,\ t\in C\}\ge4,
\qquad \ell=q-1.
\tag{1}
\]
Define \(K=\operatorname{Cay}(V,S)\), the graph with edges \(\{x,x+s\}\) for \(x\in V,s\in S\), and let \(\tau(x)=x+t\). Since \(t\notin S\) and \(t\) is not the sum of two distinct members of \(S\), \(\tau\) acts freely on edges and the quotient \(G=K/\langle\tau\rangle\) is a simple connected graph. Put \(H=L(G)\), and let \(B_H\) denote its binary vertex-edge incidence matrix. The two-sheeted cover \(L(K)\to H\) has a monodromy class represented by an edge cochain \(a\in\mathbb F_2^{E(H)}\). Adjoin a port column \(p\) and define the pointed binary matroid
\[
\boxed{\mathfrak D(N,t)
= M\!\left(\begin{array}{c|c}B_H&0\\a&1\end{array}\right)^*.}
\tag{2}
\]
Changing the cochain representing monodromy adds a cut to \(a\), inducing an elementary row operation in (2). Binary representations of a fixed binary matroid are equivalent under invertible linear changes of coordinates, which induce Cayley-graph isomorphisms. Thus the pointed isomorphism type in (2) depends only on \((N,t)\).

**Theorem 1 (invariant cube core and port cogirth).** The port cogirth of \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) is \(q\). Moreover, there exists a contraction
\[
\boxed{\mathfrak D(N,t)/T\cong D_\ell,\qquad
g_p(\mathfrak D(N,t))=g_p(D_\ell)=\ell+1=q,}
\tag{3}
\]
where \(D_\ell\) is the pointed dual associated with antipodally odd edge colorings of \(Q_\ell\).

*Proof.* Choose a shortest circuit \(C\ni t\) of \(N\), and put \(A=C\setminus\{t\}\). The \(\ell\) vectors of \(A\) are linearly independent, with sum \(t\). For any \(x\in V\), the edges of \(K\) in directions \(A\) on \(x+\operatorname{span}(A)\) form a cube \(Q_\ell\) invariant under \(\tau\). This cube is induced in \(K\). Indeed, if \(s\in S\setminus A\) were in \(\operatorname{span}(A)\), simplicity would give \(s=\sum_{a\in W}a\) for some \(W\subseteq A\) with \(|W|\ge2\); then
\[
t=s+\sum_{a\in A\setminus W}a
\]
would express \(t\) using \(\ell-|W|+1<\ell\) generators, contradicting (1). Hence its quotient is an induced folded cube inside \(G\), and the associated line graph \(H_\ell\) is an induced subgraph of \(H\). Restrict the matrix preceding dualization in (2) to its turn edges together with \(p\). After deleting zero incidence rows, the restriction is row-equivalent to the pointed matrix defining \(D_\ell^*\), because the restricted covering-monodromy class is that of the antipodal cube covering. Duality exchanges deletion before dualization with contraction afterward. This gives the contraction in (3).

A cocircuit of \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) containing \(p\) is a circuit of the matrix preceding dualization that contains \(p\). Its deletion of \(p\) is a simple cycle \(C_H\) of \(H\) with odd covering monodromy. Lift the cyclic sequence of line-graph vertices to edges of \(K\) ending at the translate by \(t\) of the first edge. Their successive contact vertices determine a walk in \(K\) from some \(u\) to \(u+t\), using at most \(|C_H|\) generator steps. Every such walk uses at least \(\ell\) steps, since a shortest generator expression for \(t\) has length \(\ell\) by (1). Thus \(|C_H|\ge\ell\). Conversely, a path in the invariant cube using each generator of \(A\) once joins \(u\) to \(u+t\), and cyclic completion of its turn sequence gives an odd-monodromy cycle of \(H\) with length \(\ell\). Therefore the shortest port cocircuit has size \(\ell+1=q\). \(\square\)

**Conjecture 2 (binary-generator short-port intersection).** Every simple pointed binary matroid \((N,t)\) satisfying (1) has
\[
\boxed{P_4(\mathfrak D(N,t),p):\quad
\forall X\in Z(\mathfrak D(N,t)),\ p\in X,\quad
\exists Y\in\mathcal C^*(\mathfrak D(N,t)):
p\in Y,\ |Y|=q,\ |X\cap Y|\le4.}
\tag{4}
\]
The strengthened conjecture \(P_2\) replaces the intersection bound four by two.

**Corollary 3 (equivalence of the generalized conjecture and NORI1).** Conjecture 2 for all \((N,t)\) is equivalent to the unrestricted two-switch edge-coloring conjecture for hypercubes. The \(P_2\) version is equivalent to the unrestricted monochromatic-geodesic conjecture.

*Proof.* By Theorem 1 and the port-cogirth-preserving contraction theorem of the preceding Subsection, the corresponding cube assertion for every dimension \(\ell\ge3\) implies (4) for every \((N,t)\). Conversely, choose \(N=U_{\ell,\ell+1}\), the binary uniform matroid of rank \(\ell\) with one additional element \(t\) equal to the sum of the \(\ell\) basis elements. The Cayley graph is then \(Q_\ell\) and \(\mathfrak D(N,t)=D_\ell\). Applying (4) gives the original assertion in every dimension. The same reasoning applies to \(P_2\). \(\square\)

For a non-cubical instance take \(V=\mathbb F_2^6\) and
\[
S=\{e_1,\ldots,e_6,\ e_1+e_2+e_6\},\qquad
t=e_1+e_2+e_3+e_4+e_5.
\]
There are two shortest five-generator expressions for \(t\), using respectively \(\{e_1,\ldots,e_5\}\) and \(\{e_3,e_4,e_5,e_6,e_1+e_2+e_6\}\). Thus \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) has distinct invariant-cube cores. The graph \(K\) has 64 vertices of degree seven; \(G\) has 32 vertices and 112 edges; \(H\) has 112 vertices and 672 turns. Consequently \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) has 673 elements, rank 561, and port cogirth six, while its cogirth-preserving cubical contraction \(D_5\) has 161 elements and rank 121.

This construction gives a matroidal generalization with arbitrary binary dependencies among the generators. The equivalence in Corollary 3 also identifies its current limitation: the sufficient contraction hypothesis already contains the cube's central difficulty. A broader intrinsic characterization that dispenses with cubical contraction, or one that also encodes ordinary reversal-odd boundary tournaments with the same witness principle, remains open.

Let \(n\ge4\) and let \(b(u,v,w)\in\mathbb F_2\), for distinct \(u,v,w\in[n]\), satisfy \(b(w,v,u)=1+b(u,v,w)\). All binary additions below are modulo two, but switch weights are integer sums.

**Theorem 1 (boundary-tournament double cover).** Let \(S_n\) be the undirected graph on ordered pairs \((u,v)\), \(u\ne v\), with an edge between \((u,v)\) and \((v,w)\) whenever \(u,v,w\) are distinct. The involution \(\rho(u,v)=(v,u)\) acts freely on its vertices and edges. There is a connected regular two-sheeted covering
\[
\boxed{S_n\longrightarrow F_n=L(K_n),\qquad (u,v)\mapsto\{u,v\},}
\tag{1}
\]
and
\[
\boxed{H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}=L(S_n)/\langle\rho\rangle\cong L^2(K_n).}
\tag{2}
\]
The boundary tournament \(b\) amounts to an antipodally odd coloring \(c_b\) of the *edges* of \(S_n\): the edge \((u,v)(v,w)\) receives color \(b(u,v,w)\), and
\[
c_b(\rho e)=1+c_b(e).\tag{3}
\]
Furthermore
\[
|V(S_n)|=n(n-1),\quad |E(S_n)|=n(n-1)(n-2),\quad
|E(F_n)|=n\binom{n-1}{2}.\tag{4}
\]

*Proof.* Each undirected edge of \(S_n\) has a unique natural orientation \((u,v)\to(v,w)\). Applying \(\rho\) to this edge produces the edge naturally oriented \((w,v)\to(v,u)\), so (3) is precisely the reversal-oddness of \(b\). Above the vertex \(\{u,v\}\) of \(L(K_n)\) lie two states \((u,v)\) and \((v,u)\). At either state, the neighbors project bijectively to all edges of \(K_n\) incident to \(\{u,v\}\); thus (1) is a regular covering. For four distinct \(u,v,w,z\), the walk
\[
(u,v),(v,w),(z,v),(v,u)
\]
joins the states of a fiber. As \(L(K_n)\) is connected, the cover is connected. Line graphs preserve this covering and its deck quotient, proving (2). Ordered-pair and ordered-triple counting gives (4). \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (shared pointed binary lift).** For any connected regular two-sheeted graph cover \(\widetilde F\to F\) with deck involution \(\rho\), let \(H=L(F)=L(\widetilde F)/\rho\). Color the edges of \(\widetilde F\) by a function \(c\) with \(c(\rho e)=1+c(e)\). For incident cover edges \(e,f\), define the projected turn cochain
\[
d([\{e,f\}])=c(e)+c(f).\tag{5}
\]
If \(\alpha\) is the covering monodromy on the binary cycle space of \(H\), then the cochains arising in this way comprise the affine coset
\[
\boxed{d\in a+B^1(H;\mathbb F_2),\quad d(C)=\alpha(C)
\text{ for every binary cycle }C,}\tag{6}
\]
where \(a\) represents \(\alpha\). The coloring is reconstructed from \(d\) up to global color complementation. With \(B_H\) the binary incidence matrix, define the pointed binary matroid
\[
\boxed{D(F,\rho)=
M\left(\begin{array}{c|c}B_H&0\\a&1\end{array}\right)^*,}\tag{7}
\]
with distinguished element \(p\). Its binary cycles through \(p\) are \(X_d=\operatorname{supp}(d)\cup\{p\}\), while cocircuits through \(p\) are \(Y_C=C\cup\{p\}\) for odd-monodromy simple cycles \(C\) of \(H\). Their intersections satisfy
\[
|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+\sum_{e\in C}d(e)\equiv0\pmod2.\tag{8}
\]
In particular, boundary tournaments modulo global complementation correspond bijectively to the port-containing cycles of \(D_n^{\mathrm{BT}}=D(F_n,\rho)\), an affine space of dimension
\[
\boxed{n\binom{n-1}{2}-1.}\tag{9}
\]
Taking \(\widetilde F=Q_n\), \(F=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), recovers the pointed cube matroid of Article XI.

*Proof.* Equation (5) is unchanged when both incident edges are acted upon by \(\rho\). A closed walk in \(H\) lifts to a turn walk in \(L(\widetilde F)\) whose final edge is either the initial edge or its deck image; telescoping the color differences gives \(d(C)=\alpha(C)\). Choose a reference odd coloring \(c_0\), selecting one cover edge from each deck pair. Its turn cochain \(a_0\) has these same cycle sums. Hence every admissible \(d\) differs from \(a_0\) by a coboundary \(\delta f\). Lifting \(f\) to a deck-invariant edge function on \(\widetilde F\) produces \(c=c_0+f\); connectedness shows that global complementation is the sole ambiguity. The dual cycle space in (7) is the row space of the displayed matrix. A minimal dependence containing the port comprises the port and one simple cycle on which \(a\) has odd sum. These observations yield (8). Connectedness gives the cut-space dimension \(|V(H)|-1=|E(F)|-1\), proving (9). \(\square\)

**Theorem 3 (the short-port decoding obstruction).** For \(n\ge4\), the port cogirth of \(D_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\) is four:
\[
\boxed{g_p(D_n^{\mathrm{BT}})=4.}\tag{10}
\]
Its shortest port cocircuits correspond to the three-edge stars \(\{va,vb,vc\}\) of the original complete graph \(K_n\), with \(a,b,c,v\) distinct. Consequently *every* port-containing cycle \(X\) and *every* shortest port cocircuit \(Y\) satisfy
\[
\boxed{|X\cap Y|\in\{2,4\}.}\tag{11}
\]
Thus a universal four-intersection theorem for this pointed matroid says nothing about long vertex-simple monochromatic tight paths.

*Proof.* The three-step cover walk
\[
(a,v),(v,b),(c,v),(v,a)=\rho(a,v)
\]
projects to a triangle in \(F_n=L(K_n)\), on vertices \(\{va,vb,vc\}\), with nontrivial monodromy. Its three consecutive cover edges project to a monodromy-one turn triangle in \(H=L(F_n)\), producing a port cocircuit of size four. There are no shorter simple cycles in \(H\), proving (10). Every graph triangle in a line graph \(L(F)\) is either a triangle of edges incident at one vertex of \(F\) (whose lifted turn monodromy is zero), or the three consecutive edges of a triangle of \(F\). Triangles of \(F_n=L(K_n)\) themselves come from either three edges incident at one vertex of \(K_n\), with monodromy one, or the three edges of a triangle of \(K_n\), with monodromy zero: the latter lifts to the closed directed state path \((a,b),(b,c),(c,a),(a,b)\). This classifies the shortest port cocircuits. Binary cycle--cocircuit orthogonality makes their intersections even; since both sets contain \(p\), such an intersection is either two or four. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (local tournaments and two-intersection).** The shortest port cocircuit arising from the star \(\{va,vb,vc\}\) has intersection two with \(X_{d_b}\) if the restriction of the middle-local tournament at \(v\) to \(\{a,b,c\}\) is transitive, and intersection four if it is a directed three-cycle. In particular, for every \(n\ge5\), all port-containing cycles \(X\) have a *shortest* port cocircuit \(Y\) with
\[
\boxed{|X\cap Y|=2.}\tag{12}
\]
For \(n=4\), taking every middle-local tournament to be cyclic produces a port cycle whose intersection with every shortest port cocircuit is four.

*Proof.* Order \(a<b<c\) and set \(x=b(a,v,b)\), \(y=b(b,v,c)\), \(z=b(a,v,c)\). The corresponding cyclic turn word lifts from three cover edges colored \(x,1-y,1-z\), and its integer cyclic switch weight is
\[
w=[x=y]+[y\ne z]+[z\ne x].
\]
This equals three precisely when \(x=y\ne z\), the cyclic tournament, and one otherwise. Its port intersection is \(w+1\). Every tournament on at least four vertices contains a transitive triangle: choose a vertex with at least two outneighbors or at least two inneighbors. The local tournament has \(n-1\ge4\) vertices when \(n\ge5\). The cyclic choices at \(n=4\) are permitted independently at each center. \(\square\)

**Theorem 5 (the missing auxiliary graphic matroid).** A vertex tuple \(P=(v_1,\ldots,v_m)\), \(m\ge3\), determines a naturally directed path in \(S_n\) through states
\[
s_i=(v_i,v_{i+1})\quad(1\le i<m),
\]
whose \(m-2\) edges \(e_i=s_i s_{i+1}\) are colored
\(b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\). Let \(t_i\) be the turn of \(H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\) induced by \(e_i,e_{i+1}\). Then
\[
\boxed{d_b(t_i)=
b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})+
b(v_{i+1},v_{i+2},v_{i+3}).}\tag{13}
\]
The tuple \(P\) is vertex-simple precisely when its projected state set
\[
\{\{v_i,v_{i+1}\}:1\le i<m\}
\tag{14}
\]
is independent in the *graphic matroid* \(M(K_n)\), provided the cover path follows the natural orientations of all \(S_n\)-edges. Consequently the maximum length of a positive tight path in \(b\) is the maximum size of a naturally directed \(S_n\)-path whose projected state labels form an independent set in \(M(K_n)\) and whose induced \(H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\)-turn path has all turn labels zero.

*Proof.* Consecutive edges of the directed state path share the state \((v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\), proving (13). Its projected states are the consecutive edges of the original vertex walk in \(K_n\). A vertex-simple walk is a tree path and its edge set is graphic-independent. Conversely, a repeated original vertex in a nonbacktracking walk, as enforced by the state transitions, creates a closed subwalk of length at least three and hence a graphic cycle. Thus graphic independence is equivalent to vertex simplicity. An all-zero turn word makes all consecutive triple colors agree. If their common color is zero, reversal of the original tuple complements every triple color, yielding a positive tight path of the same length; therefore the maximum for positive words equals the maximum for arbitrary monochromatic words. \(\square\)

**Theorem 6 (shared short-cycle generation).** Let \(\widetilde F\to F\) be any regular connected two-cover, let \(H=L(F)\), and denote the monodromies by \(\beta\) on \(F\) and \(\alpha\) on \(H\). If \(T_H\) is the span of triangles inside vertex-star cliques of \(H\), then the incidence-subdivision turn map yields
\[
0\longrightarrow T_H\longrightarrow Z_1(H;\mathbb F_2)
\xrightarrow{\varphi}Z_1(F;\mathbb F_2)\longrightarrow0,
\qquad \alpha=\beta\circ\varphi.
\tag{15}
\]
In the boundary-tournament case, \(\ker\alpha\) is generated by (a) star triangles of \(H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\), (b) turn triangles corresponding to three-edge triangles in \(K_n\), and (c) binary sums of two turn triangles corresponding to three-edge stars in \(K_n\). These generators have support cardinality at most six. In the cube case, the kernel is generated by star triangles and square turn cycles, as proved earlier in Article XI.

*Proof.* A turn between two \(F\)-edges incident at \(v\) maps to the sum of their two incident half-edges in the subdivision of \(F\). This gives a surjection of binary cycle spaces from \(H=L(F)\) onto \(F\). The kernel in each incident-edge clique is its graph cycle space, generated by triangles, proving (15). The covering monodromy tracks the lifted contact-vertex walk, so \(\alpha=\beta\circ\varphi\). Apply the same sequence to \(F_n=L(K_n)\). Its cycle space is generated by three-edge stars of \(K_n\) and three-edge triangles of \(K_n\), since the cycle space of \(K_n\) is triangle-generated. The first type has \(\beta=1\) and the second \(\beta=0\), by Theorem 3. Therefore \(\ker\beta\) is generated by the second type and binary sums of pairs of the first type. Lift these elements back through \(\varphi\), adding the star-triangle kernel \(T_H\), to obtain the asserted generators. The cube comparison follows from the previously established square-generation theorem. \(\square\)

**Research consequence.** Cube edge colorings and boundary tournaments share the same functorial pointed binary *line-graph cover lift*, the affine turn cohomology class, and bounded-support generators for its monodromy-zero cycles. But the boundary-tournament four-intersection property is automatic because its port cogirth is four. Long tight paths correspond instead to zero-turn paths satisfying coherent orientation and an independent-set condition in \(M(K_n)\). Accordingly, a common theorem strong enough to advance both problems needs the pointed matroid *decorated with a matroid-constrained path family*, rather than just its collection of shortest port cocircuits. This identifies a structural research direction; it does not assert the unresolved long-path or two-switch conjectures.
