# Two-path connector theorem for all bipointed cocircuit sectors

Let \(H\) be a finite graph equipped with two binary cohomology classes \(\alpha,\lambda\in H^1(H;\mathbb F_2)\). The relevant instance is the two-port line-graph lift of Article XI, in which these classes are covering monodromy and orientation curvature. Put
\[
\sigma(C)=(\alpha(C),\lambda(C))\in\mathbb F_2^2
\]
for any graph cycle \(C\). Let \(w:E(H)\to\mathbb R_{\ge0}\) be any nonnegative edge cost, with \(w(C)=\sum_{e\in C}w(e)\).

**Theorem 1 (two-connector sector completion).** Let \(C_1,C_2\) be vertex-disjoint simple cycles of \(H\). Assume they are joined by two vertex-disjoint paths \(P,Q\), whose interiors avoid both cycles, such that \(P\) connects \(a_1\in C_1\) to \(a_2\in C_2\), \(Q\) connects \(b_1\in C_1\) to \(b_2\in C_2\), and \(a_i\ne b_i\) for \(i=1,2\). Let \(A_i^0,A_i^1\) be the two \(a_i\)-to-\(b_i\) arcs of \(C_i\). For \(\varepsilon,\delta\in\mathbb F_2\), define
\[
\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta}=
A_1^\varepsilon\cup P\cup A_2^\delta\cup Q.
\tag{1}
\]
Each \(\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta}\) is a simple cycle, and
\[
\boxed{\sigma(\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta})
=\sigma(\Gamma_{0,0})+\varepsilon\sigma(C_1)+\delta\sigma(C_2).}
\tag{2}
\]
If \(\sigma(C_1),\sigma(C_2)\) are linearly independent in \(\mathbb F_2^2\), the four simple cycles (1) realize all four possible two-port signature sectors, one in each sector. Every one satisfies
\[
\boxed{|\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta}|\le |C_1|+|C_2|+|P|+|Q|,\qquad
w(\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta})
\le w(C_1)+w(C_2)+w(P)+w(Q).}
\tag{3}
\]
Consequently, if \(P,Q\) are zero-cost paths, all four sectors are realized by simple cycles whose cost is at most \(w(C_1)+w(C_2)\).

*Proof.* The two arcs of each \(C_i\) meet only at their endpoints, and the connector interiors avoid both cycles and one another. Thus (1) is one simple cycle. In the binary graph cycle space the symmetric difference of its two choices of the first arc is the full cycle \(C_1\), and similarly for the second arc:
\[
\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta}
=\Gamma_{0,0}\triangle(\varepsilon C_1)\triangle(\delta C_2).
\]
Applying the two linear cycle functionals gives (2). Independence of the two signature vectors makes the affine map \((\varepsilon,\delta)\mapsto\sigma(\Gamma_{\varepsilon,\delta})\) a bijection of \(\mathbb F_2^2\). For each choice, one uses only one arc from each input cycle and both connecting paths; nonnegativity gives (3). \(\square\)

**Corollary 2 (bipointed cocircuit repair by zero-cost connectors).** Let \(D^{(2)}\) be the dual of the two-port incidence/monodromy/curvature matrix from Article XI. Suppose \(C_1,C_2\) are vertex-disjoint simple turn cycles whose signatures \((\alpha,\lambda)\) are independent. If they admit two disjoint connecting paths of zero turn cost for the prescribed port-containing binary cycle \(X_d\), then for every \(\eta\in\mathbb F_2^2\) there exists a simple cycle \(C_\eta\) with signature \(\eta\) and
\[
w_d(C_\eta)\le w_d(C_1)+w_d(C_2).
\]
In particular \(\eta=(1,1)\) gives a cocircuit \(C_\eta\cup\{p,q\}\) containing both ports, whereas \(\eta=(1,0)\) gives a cocircuit containing \(p\) but avoiding \(q\). For the admissible port cycle \(X_d\), either such cocircuit has intersection \(1+w_d(C_\eta)\).

*Proof.* Apply Theorem 1 with the nonnegative integer cost \(d\). In the two-port representation, a simple turn cycle \(C\) closes to the cocircuit obtained by adjoining \(p\) when \(\alpha(C)=1\) and \(q\) when \(\lambda(C)=1\). The specified port cycle \(X_d\) includes \(p\), excludes \(q\), and records the support of \(d\) on the turn edges. \(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (Menger criterion for zero-cost sector completion).** Let \(H_0(d)\) be the subgraph of zero-cost turns. If one 2-vertex-connected block of \(H_0(d)\) intersects each of two vertex-disjoint simple cycles \(C_1,C_2\) in at least two vertices, and their signatures are independent, then all four port sectors admit the bounded-cost simple-cycle witnesses of Corollary 2.

*Proof.* The vertex form of Menger's theorem, applied inside the 2-connected block to the two disjoint vertex sets given by its intersections with \(C_1,C_2\), yields two vertex-disjoint zero-cost paths connecting the sets. Truncate each at its last point of \(C_1\) and first point of \(C_2\). Their interiors then avoid both cycles and remain mutually disjoint, and their endpoints on each cycle are distinct. Corollary 2 applies. \(\square\)

Theorem 1 does not require graph-cover structure: it is valid for any two binary classes on the cycle space of any graph. In the two-port signed-cover application it supplies a **cost-controlled, phase-prescribed cocircuit selection mechanism** that does not require the two input cycles to intersect. It does not guarantee that a selected simple cycle is resource-independent or coherently directed; those additional path-language restrictions remain central to the shared NORI1/boundary-tournament conjecture.
