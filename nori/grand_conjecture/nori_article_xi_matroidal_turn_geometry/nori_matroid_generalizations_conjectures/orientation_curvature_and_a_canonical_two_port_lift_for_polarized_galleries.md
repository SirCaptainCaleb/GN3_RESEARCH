# Orientation curvature and a canonical two-port lift for polarized galleries

# A canonical second port: orientation curvature and coherent galleries

Let \(\widetilde F\to F\) be a connected regular two-sheeted cover of finite connected simple graphs with deck involution \(\rho\). Assume \(F\) has a vertex of degree at least three, and put \(H=L(F)=L(\widetilde F)/\rho\). Article XI already defines the binary monodromy cochain \(a\), the pointed dual lift, and the color-dependent turn-signature class. The following new cohomology class is intrinsic to the same cover and distinguishes different *types of path closure*.

**Definition.** Orient the edges of \(\widetilde F\) so that \(\rho\) reverses their orientations. This can always be arranged because the deck action is free on edge orbits. For a quotient turn \(t\in E(H)\), choose incident lifted edges \(e,f\) meeting at a state \(v\). Define
\[
\lambda(t)=0\quad\text{if one edge enters and the other leaves }v,\qquad
\lambda(t)=1\quad\text{if both enter or both leave }v.
\tag{1}
\]
Reversing both orientations under \(\rho\) preserves this label, so \(\lambda\) is a cochain on \(H\).

**Theorem 1 (canonical orientation-curvature class).** Its class \([\lambda]\) modulo the cut space of \(H\) does not depend on which anti-equivariant orientations were chosen. For every star triangle \(T\) in \(H\), corresponding to three edges of \(F\) incident at one vertex,
\[
\boxed{\alpha(T)=0,\qquad\lambda(T)=1.}\tag{2}
\]
Consequently \([\lambda]\) and covering monodromy \([a]\) are independent binary cohomology classes.

*Proof.* Reorienting a deck-orbit of cover edges toggles the sense at every incident turn and therefore adds the vertex cut in \(H\) supported at the orbit corresponding to that vertex of \(H\). All reorientations act by sums of such cuts. A star triangle lifts to three cover edges meeting at one vertex, hence has monodromy zero. If the three incidence senses are \(b_1,b_2,b_3\), its curvature labels are \(1+b_1+b_2\), \(1+b_2+b_3\), and \(1+b_3+b_1\), summing to one over \(\mathbb F_2\). Since the cover is connected, monodromy is nonzero on some cycle, while the star triangle separates \([\lambda]\) from both zero and \([a]\). \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (stationary-contact parity identity).** Let \(C\) be a simple cycle of \(H\), of length \(r\), and lift it to cover edges \(e_1,\ldots,e_r,e_{r+1}=\rho^\varepsilon e_1\), where \(\varepsilon=\alpha(C)\). Let \(v_i\) be the contact vertex of \(e_i,e_{i+1}\), and \(v_0=\rho^\varepsilon v_r\). Define \(s(C)=|\{i:v_{i-1}=v_i\}|\). Then
\[
\boxed{\lambda(C)\equiv\alpha(C)+s(C)\pmod2.}\tag{3}
\]
In particular a monodromy-one cycle with no stationary contact has curvature one, while a monodromy-one cycle built entirely from coherently directed transitions, all labeled \(\lambda=0\), has an odd number of stationary contacts.

*Proof.* For an oriented cover edge \(e\) and its incident vertex \(v\), set \(h(e,v)=1\) if \(v\) is the head of \(e\) and zero if it is the tail. The turn at \(v_i\) has
\[
\lambda_i=1+h(e_i,v_i)+h(e_{i+1},v_i).
\]
Sum over \(i\). The seam contributes \(\varepsilon\), because the orientation of \(\rho^\varepsilon e_1\) is the reversal of that of \(e_1\) when \(\varepsilon=1\). Each internal cover edge contributes one when its two contact vertices are different, and zero when they coincide. Thus
\[
\lambda(C)\equiv r+\varepsilon+(r-s(C))
\equiv\varepsilon+s(C)\pmod2.
\]
\(\square\)

**Theorem 3 (choice-free two-port lift).** Add distinguished columns \(p,q\), and put
\[
\boxed{\widehat M^{(2)}=
M\left(\begin{array}{c|cc}B_H&0&0\\
a&1&0\\ \lambda&0&1
\end{array}\right).}\tag{4}
\]
With its ordered pair of ports, this represented binary matroid is independent of cochain representatives and of anti-equivariant orientation choices. Its rank is \(|V(H)|+1\). Every simple graph cycle \(C\) gives a circuit
\[
\boxed{C\cup\bigl(\{p\}\text{ if }\alpha(C)=1\bigr)
\cup\bigl(\{q\}\text{ if }\lambda(C)=1\bigr).}\tag{5}
\]
The four signature sectors \((\alpha,\lambda)\in\mathbb F_2^2\) are consequently intrinsic.

*Proof.* Altering either cochain by a cut performs row operations on (4), so it leaves the represented matroid unchanged. The two cohomology classes are independent by Theorem 1, and \(B_H\) has rank \(|V(H)|-1\), giving the rank. The columns of a simple cycle sum to zero in the incidence rows and to \((\alpha(C),\lambda(C))\) in the bottom two rows; adjoining the specified port columns gives a dependence. Every proper nonempty subset of a simple cycle has nonzero incidence boundary, and the port columns are independent, so the dependence is minimal. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (cube and boundary paths occupy different phases).** A full antipodal cube geodesic has \((\alpha,\lambda)=(1,1)\) because its lifted consecutive edge contacts are all moving. A naturally directed boundary-tournament gallery from an ordered triple state \(t\) to its reversal \(\rho t\) has \((\alpha,\lambda)=(1,0)\), since all its consecutive directed turns have opposite incidence senses. The spurious minimum-port boundary star triangles have \((\alpha,\lambda)=(1,1)\), and hence lie in the opposite phase from coherent directed tournament galleries. This distinction is preserved by the two-port matroid.

**Theorem 5 (minimum coherent closing length and repeated resources).** In the ordered-pair boundary cover, a naturally directed sequence of triple-edge states beginning with \((a,b,c)\) and ending with its reversal \((c,b,a)\) must contain at least five directed turns. Five suffice, using four distinct original vertices \(a,b,c,d\):
\[
(a,b,c),(b,c,a),(c,a,d),(a,d,c),(d,c,b),(c,b,a).
\tag{6}
\]
Its first five reversal-orbits are distinct, so it yields a simple monodromy-one cycle of length five. Nevertheless the underlying original vertex word
\[
a,b,c,a,d,c,b,a
\tag{7}
\]
repeats vertices, and is not a matroid-independent tight path.

*Proof.* If a directed sequence has \(r\) turns, it reads a word \(x_1,\ldots,x_{r+3}\), each consecutive triple having distinct entries. The twisted terminal constraint reads
\((x_{r+1},x_{r+2},x_{r+3})=(x_3,x_2,x_1)\).
For \(r=2\) it yields the forbidden triple \((x_2,x_3,x_2)\); for \(r=3\) an adjacent equality \(x_4=x_3\); for \(r=4\) a forbidden triple \((x_3,x_4,x_3)\); and \(r=0,1\) are immediately impossible. Hence \(r\ge5\). The sequence (6) supplies the claimed example and its reversal-orbits are pairwise distinct. \(\square\)

**Theorem 6 (the tournament closing seam width three is optimal).** For pairwise distinct \(v_1,\ldots,v_m\), \(m\ge6\), the full tight triple sequence from \((v_1,v_2,v_3)\) to \((v_{m-2},v_{m-1},v_m)\) needs at least three directed transitions to reach the reversal \((v_3,v_2,v_1)\). The three-turn continuation
\[
(v_{m-1},v_m,v_3),\quad
(v_m,v_3,v_2),\quad
(v_3,v_2,v_1)
\tag{8}
\]
attains this minimum.

*Proof.* A one-step continuation would require \((v_{m-1},v_m)=(v_3,v_2)\), impossible by injectivity. A two-step continuation would require \(v_m=v_3\), also impossible. The continuation (8) respects consecutive ordered-pair overlaps and has the simple closing quotient proved in the earlier seam theorem. \(\square\)

**Proposition 7 (two ports are not enough).** In \(H_n^{\rm BT}\), \(n\ge4\), the four successive triple-state orbits represented by
\[
(1,0,2),\ (2,0,3),\ (1,0,3),\ (0,1,3)
\tag{9}
\]
form a simple cycle \(C\) with \((\alpha(C),\lambda(C))=(1,0)\), yet two of its turns are incoherent. Indeed, lift the four states and closing mate as
\[
(1,0,2),\ (3,0,2),\ (3,0,1),\ (0,1,3),\ (2,0,1).
\tag{10}
\]
The first two transitions are head--head and tail--tail respectively, while the other two are head--tail or tail--head. Hence curvature parity vanishes, although these are not all legal directed transitions. Thus the second port is an intrinsic useful refinement, but a valid long-path conjecture still must specify a *coherent directed witness family with an independent resource matroid*.

**Conjectural program.** Refine the pointed-gallery intersection conjecture to a *phase-prescribed two-port* theorem. Select odd-monodromy closed witnesses from the \((1,1)\) phase for full cube geodesics and from the \((1,0)\) phase for coherently directed tournament galleries, subject in both cases to independent resources. Theorem 6 explains why the boundary seam budget is three, rather than an artifact of one arbitrary closing construction. Theorem 5 and Proposition 7 demonstrate that a phase restriction alone still admits short resource-repeating or incoherent cycles. No universal four-intersection or two-intersection selector for the decorated two-port system is presently proved.

**Theorem 8 (seam triangle contraction changes curvature phase).** Let \(C\) be the length-\(m\) monodromy-one turn cycle obtained from a coherent directed twisted closure
\[
e_1\longrightarrow e_2\longrightarrow\cdots\longrightarrow e_m
\longrightarrow \rho e_1
\tag{11}
\]
in an oriented covering graph, with pairwise distinct quotient edge-state orbits, \(m\ge4\). Then the canonical lifted cyclic contact sequence of \(C\) has
\[
\boxed{s(C)=1,\qquad (\alpha(C),\lambda(C))=(1,0).}\tag{12}
\]
The unique stationary contact occurs at the first edge-state \(e_1\), because it is reached from the deck-translated predecessor and departed from through its head. Removing that edge-state by contracting its star triangle produces a simple cycle \(C'\) of \(H\) with
\[
\boxed{|C'|=m-1,\qquad
(\alpha(C'),\lambda(C'))=(1,1),\qquad
w_d(C')\le w_d(C)}
\tag{13}
\]
for every admissible deck-odd turn signature \(d\). The cost difference belongs to \(\{0,2\}\). This move therefore preserves cover monodromy and never increases coloring cost, but it **leaves the coherent-gallery phase**.

*Proof.* Each interior directed edge-state \(e_j\), \(j\ge2\), is contacted at its tail by the preceding directed edge and at its head by the succeeding one, so its contacts differ. The first edge-state \(e_1\) is contacted at its head by \(e_2\), while its other contact is the deck translate of the terminal meeting between \(e_m\) and \(\rho e_1\). Because \(\rho\) reverses the orientation, that translated contact is again the head of \(e_1\). Hence \(s(C)=1\). Theorem 2 gives \(\lambda(C)=1+s(C)=0\).

The edges of \(\widetilde F\) immediately preceding and following \(e_1\), after translating the preceding one to the same sheet, meet at the same vertex. Their three pairwise turns constitute a balanced star triangle. Replace the two consecutive turns through the vertex \([e_1]\) of \(C\) with the third side of that triangle. The resulting graph cycle \(C'\) is simple because the other quotient edge-state orbits were distinct and \(m\ge4\). It has the same monodromy, since the removed star triangle has monodromy zero. The contacts of all remaining lifted edge-states are unchanged, while the unique stationary contact of \(e_1\) is removed, giving \(s(C')=0\) and \(\lambda(C')=1\).

If the lifted edge-state colors in the star triangle are \(x,y,z\in\mathbb F_2\), its turn-cost change is
\[
(x\oplus y)+(y\oplus z)-(x\oplus z)
=2\,\mathbf1_{\{x=z\ne y\}}\in\{0,2\}.
\]
Thus \(w_d(C')\le w_d(C)\) simultaneously for every admissible coloring. \(\square\)

**Exchange warning.** Theorem 8 identifies a structural failure mode of undecorated cocircuit minimization. A cost-nonincreasing contraction of a marked tournament cocircuit may return a shorter cocircuit with the wrong orientation-curvature phase, even before resource independence is considered. A successful unifying exchange theorem must either preserve the prescribed \(\lambda\)-phase and coherent state language, or accompany the shortening by a controlled phase-repair splice. This is a stronger necessary design criterion than preserving only the original monodromy port.

**Theorem 9 (orientation curvature is monodromy plus a cover-independent line-graph class).** There is a canonical cohomology class \([\kappa_F]\in \mathbb F_2^{E(L(F))}/B^1(L(F))\), defined without reference to the covering \(\widetilde F\to F\), such that
\[
\boxed{[\lambda]=[a]+[\kappa_F].}\tag{14}
\]
To define \(\kappa_F\), orient the edges of the *base graph* \(F\) arbitrarily and, for each turn of \(H=L(F)\), set \(\kappa_F(t)=1\) if the two base edges meeting at its center have the same incidence sense, and zero otherwise. Its class is independent of those orientations. For every simple turn cycle \(C\),
\[
\boxed{\kappa_F(C)\equiv s(C)\pmod2.}\tag{15}
\]
Thus the additional binary datum is the universal *stationary-contact curvature of the line graph*, and the orientation-curvature phase of the cover equals this class twisted by monodromy. In the cube target, full geodesic cycles satisfy \((\alpha,\kappa_F)=(1,0)\). In the coherent boundary gallery target, closed directed galleries satisfy \((\alpha,\kappa_F)=(1,1)\). Short boundary star-triangle cycles satisfy \((\alpha,\kappa_F)=(1,0)\).

*Proof.* Reversing the orientation of an edge of \(F\) toggles \(\kappa_F\) on every turn incident with its vertex in \(L(F)\), hence adds a cut. For a lifted turn cycle \(C\), let its successive projected \(F\)-edges be \(f_1,\ldots,f_r,f_{r+1}=f_1\) with common center vertices \(w_i\), \(w_0=w_r\). Writing \(h(f,w)\) for the incidence head-bit of an oriented base edge, the turn label is
\[
\kappa_i=1+h(f_i,w_i)+h(f_{i+1},w_i).
\]
Summation yields
\[
\kappa_F(C)\equiv r+
\sum_{i=1}^r\bigl(h(f_i,w_{i-1})+h(f_i,w_i)\bigr)
\equiv r+(r-s(C))=s(C).
\]
Together with Theorem 2, this gives \(\lambda(C)=\alpha(C)+\kappa_F(C)\) for every cycle \(C\), hence (14) because a cochain annihilating the graph cycle space is a cut. The three model-specific pairs follow from their stationary-contact counts already proved. \(\square\)

**Structural significance.** Equation (14) removes any dependence on an arbitrary orientation upstairs: the two cohomological degrees of freedom are the covering class \([a]\) and an intrinsic characteristic class \([\kappa_F]\) of the base line graph. The common pointed-matroid generalization can therefore be phrased as a graph-cover lift *with its canonical line-graph contact curvature*. This is a cleaner mathematical hypothesis than adding unrelated direction or seam labels, although the counterexamples in Theorems 5 and 7 show that resource independence and coherent orientation remain necessary for long-path decoding.
