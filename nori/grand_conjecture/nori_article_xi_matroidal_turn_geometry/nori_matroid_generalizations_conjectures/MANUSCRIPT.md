## Matroid Generalizations and Short-Port Intersection Conjectures

Let \(M\) be a finite binary matroid and let \(p\in E(M)\) belong to a circuit and a cocircuit. Define the **port cogirth**
\[
g_p(M)=\min\{|Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(M),\ p\in Y\},
\]
where \(Z(M)\) denotes the binary cycle space. For an even positive integer \(b\), define the **short-port intersection property** \(P_b(M,p)\) by
\[
\boxed{\forall X\in Z(M)\ (p\in X),\quad
\exists Y\in\mathcal C^*(M):
p\in Y,\ |Y|=g_p(M),\ |X\cap Y|\le b.}\tag{1}
\]
Cycle–cocircuit orthogonality over \(\mathbb F_2\) forces every intersection in (1) to have positive even cardinality.

In Article XI's pointed dual \(D_n\), shortest port cocircuits are the cyclic turn encodings of antipodal geodesics, and every port-containing binary cycle encodes an antipodally odd cube-edge coloring. Thus \(P_4(D_n,p)\) is equivalent to the unrestricted two-switch conjecture, while \(P_2(D_n,p)\) is equivalent to monochromatic NORI1.

**Proposition 1 (small port cogirth).** Every pointed binary matroid with \(g_p(M)\le5\) has \(P_4\). Every pointed binary matroid with \(g_p(M)\le3\) has \(P_2\).

*Proof.* Fix any shortest port cocircuit \(Y\). For every binary cycle \(X\ni p\), the intersection \(X\cap Y\) is nonempty, even, and of size at most \(g_p(M)\). The asserted bounds follow. \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (port-cogirth-preserving contraction inheritance).** Let \(T\subseteq E(M)\setminus\{p\}\), put \(M_0=M/T\), and assume
\[
g_p(M)=g_p(M_0).\tag{2}
\]
For any positive even \(b\), if \(P_b(M_0,p)\) holds, then \(P_b(M,p)\) holds.

*Proof.* Write \(S=E(M)\setminus T\). Take any binary cycle \(X\in Z(M)\) with \(p\in X\). The restriction \(X_0=X\cap S\) is a binary cycle of \(M/T\), and \(p\in X_0\). Choose by \(P_b(M_0,p)\) a cocircuit \(Y\ni p\) of \(M_0\) satisfying \(|Y|=g_p(M_0)\) and \(|X_0\cap Y|\le b\). Cocircuits of \(M/T\) are precisely the cocircuits of \(M\) disjoint from \(T\). Hence \(Y\) is a cocircuit of \(M\), and (2) makes it shortest among those containing \(p\). Finally \(Y\subseteq S\) gives
\[
|X\cap Y|=|X_0\cap Y|\le b.
\]
\(\square\)

**Corollary 3 (cubical contraction class).** Suppose a pointed binary matroid \(M\) has a contraction \(M/T\cong D_n\), with \(p\notin T\), and \(g_p(M)=n+1\). Then \(P_b(D_n,p)\) implies \(P_b(M,p)\). For \(b=2,4\), the universal \(P_b\) assertion over all such matroids and all \(n\ge3\) is equivalent to the respective cube conjecture, since the class includes \(M=D_n\) with \(T=\varnothing\).

The theorem applies without restrictions on the number of elements, representational rank, or other circuits of \(M\). The port cogirth equality is essential to lifting a *minimum-size* cocircuit from the contraction.

Let \((N,t)\) be a simple binary matroid represented by pairwise distinct nonzero vectors \(S\cup\{t\}\subseteq V=\mathbb F_2^r\), with \(t\) in the span of \(S\). Let
\[
q=\min\{|C|:C\text{ a circuit of }N,\ t\in C\}\ge4,
\qquad \ell=q-1.
\tag{1}
\]
Define \(K=\operatorname{Cay}(V,S)\), the graph with edges \(\{x,x+s\}\) for \(x\in V,s\in S\), and let \(\tau(x)=x+t\). Since \(t\notin S\) and \(t\) is not the sum of two distinct members of \(S\), \(\tau\) acts freely on edges and the quotient \(G=K/\langle\tau\rangle\) is a simple connected graph. Put \(H=L(G)\), and let \(B_H\) denote its binary vertex-edge incidence matrix. The two-sheeted cover \(L(K)\to H\) has a monodromy class represented by an edge cochain \(a\in\mathbb F_2^{E(H)}\). Adjoin a port column \(p\) and define the pointed binary matroid
\[
\boxed{\mathfrak D(N,t)
= M\!\left(\begin{array}{c|c}B_H&0\\a&1\end{array}\right)^*.}
\tag{2}
\]
Changing the cochain representing monodromy adds a cut to \(a\), inducing an elementary row operation in (2). Binary representations of a fixed binary matroid are equivalent under invertible linear changes of coordinates, which induce Cayley-graph isomorphisms. Thus the pointed isomorphism type in (2) depends only on \((N,t)\).

**Theorem 1 (invariant cube core and port cogirth).** The port cogirth of \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) is \(q\). Moreover, there exists a contraction
\[
\boxed{\mathfrak D(N,t)/T\cong D_\ell,\qquad
g_p(\mathfrak D(N,t))=g_p(D_\ell)=\ell+1=q,}
\tag{3}
\]
where \(D_\ell\) is the pointed dual associated with antipodally odd edge colorings of \(Q_\ell\).

*Proof.* Choose a shortest circuit \(C\ni t\) of \(N\), and put \(A=C\setminus\{t\}\). The \(\ell\) vectors of \(A\) are linearly independent, with sum \(t\). For any \(x\in V\), the edges of \(K\) in directions \(A\) on \(x+\operatorname{span}(A)\) form a cube \(Q_\ell\) invariant under \(\tau\). This cube is induced in \(K\). Indeed, if \(s\in S\setminus A\) were in \(\operatorname{span}(A)\), simplicity would give \(s=\sum_{a\in W}a\) for some \(W\subseteq A\) with \(|W|\ge2\); then
\[
t=s+\sum_{a\in A\setminus W}a
\]
would express \(t\) using \(\ell-|W|+1<\ell\) generators, contradicting (1). Hence its quotient is an induced folded cube inside \(G\), and the associated line graph \(H_\ell\) is an induced subgraph of \(H\). Restrict the matrix preceding dualization in (2) to its turn edges together with \(p\). After deleting zero incidence rows, the restriction is row-equivalent to the pointed matrix defining \(D_\ell^*\), because the restricted covering-monodromy class is that of the antipodal cube covering. Duality exchanges deletion before dualization with contraction afterward. This gives the contraction in (3).

A cocircuit of \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) containing \(p\) is a circuit of the matrix preceding dualization that contains \(p\). Its deletion of \(p\) is a simple cycle \(C_H\) of \(H\) with odd covering monodromy. Lift the cyclic sequence of line-graph vertices to edges of \(K\) ending at the translate by \(t\) of the first edge. Their successive contact vertices determine a walk in \(K\) from some \(u\) to \(u+t\), using at most \(|C_H|\) generator steps. Every such walk uses at least \(\ell\) steps, since a shortest generator expression for \(t\) has length \(\ell\) by (1). Thus \(|C_H|\ge\ell\). Conversely, a path in the invariant cube using each generator of \(A\) once joins \(u\) to \(u+t\), and cyclic completion of its turn sequence gives an odd-monodromy cycle of \(H\) with length \(\ell\). Therefore the shortest port cocircuit has size \(\ell+1=q\). \(\square\)

**Conjecture 2 (binary-generator short-port intersection).** Every simple pointed binary matroid \((N,t)\) satisfying (1) has
\[
\boxed{P_4(\mathfrak D(N,t),p):\quad
\forall X\in Z(\mathfrak D(N,t)),\ p\in X,\quad
\exists Y\in\mathcal C^*(\mathfrak D(N,t)):
p\in Y,\ |Y|=q,\ |X\cap Y|\le4.}
\tag{4}
\]
The strengthened conjecture \(P_2\) replaces the intersection bound four by two.

**Corollary 3 (equivalence of the generalized conjecture and NORI1).** Conjecture 2 for all \((N,t)\) is equivalent to the unrestricted two-switch edge-coloring conjecture for hypercubes. The \(P_2\) version is equivalent to the unrestricted monochromatic-geodesic conjecture.

*Proof.* By Theorem 1 and the port-cogirth-preserving contraction theorem of the preceding Subsection, the corresponding cube assertion for every dimension \(\ell\ge3\) implies (4) for every \((N,t)\). Conversely, choose \(N=U_{\ell,\ell+1}\), the binary uniform matroid of rank \(\ell\) with one additional element \(t\) equal to the sum of the \(\ell\) basis elements. The Cayley graph is then \(Q_\ell\) and \(\mathfrak D(N,t)=D_\ell\). Applying (4) gives the original assertion in every dimension. The same reasoning applies to \(P_2\). \(\square\)

For a non-cubical instance take \(V=\mathbb F_2^6\) and
\[
S=\{e_1,\ldots,e_6,\ e_1+e_2+e_6\},\qquad
t=e_1+e_2+e_3+e_4+e_5.
\]
There are two shortest five-generator expressions for \(t\), using respectively \(\{e_1,\ldots,e_5\}\) and \(\{e_3,e_4,e_5,e_6,e_1+e_2+e_6\}\). Thus \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) has distinct invariant-cube cores. The graph \(K\) has 64 vertices of degree seven; \(G\) has 32 vertices and 112 edges; \(H\) has 112 vertices and 672 turns. Consequently \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\) has 673 elements, rank 561, and port cogirth six, while its cogirth-preserving cubical contraction \(D_5\) has 161 elements and rank 121.

This construction gives a matroidal generalization with arbitrary binary dependencies among the generators. The equivalence in Corollary 3 also identifies its current limitation: the sufficient contraction hypothesis already contains the cube's central difficulty. A broader intrinsic characterization that dispenses with cubical contraction, or one that also encodes ordinary reversal-odd boundary tournaments with the same witness principle, remains open.

Let \(n\ge4\) and let \(b(u,v,w)\in\mathbb F_2\), for distinct \(u,v,w\in[n]\), satisfy \(b(w,v,u)=1+b(u,v,w)\). All binary additions below are modulo two, but switch weights are integer sums.

**Theorem 1 (boundary-tournament double cover).** Let \(S_n\) be the undirected graph on ordered pairs \((u,v)\), \(u\ne v\), with an edge between \((u,v)\) and \((v,w)\) whenever \(u,v,w\) are distinct. The involution \(\rho(u,v)=(v,u)\) acts freely on its vertices and edges. There is a connected regular two-sheeted covering
\[
\boxed{S_n\longrightarrow F_n=L(K_n),\qquad (u,v)\mapsto\{u,v\},}
\tag{1}
\]
and
\[
\boxed{H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}=L(S_n)/\langle\rho\rangle\cong L^2(K_n).}
\tag{2}
\]
The boundary tournament \(b\) amounts to an antipodally odd coloring \(c_b\) of the *edges* of \(S_n\): the edge \((u,v)(v,w)\) receives color \(b(u,v,w)\), and
\[
c_b(\rho e)=1+c_b(e).\tag{3}
\]
Furthermore
\[
|V(S_n)|=n(n-1),\quad |E(S_n)|=n(n-1)(n-2),\quad
|E(F_n)|=n\binom{n-1}{2}.\tag{4}
\]

*Proof.* Each undirected edge of \(S_n\) has a unique natural orientation \((u,v)\to(v,w)\). Applying \(\rho\) to this edge produces the edge naturally oriented \((w,v)\to(v,u)\), so (3) is precisely the reversal-oddness of \(b\). Above the vertex \(\{u,v\}\) of \(L(K_n)\) lie two states \((u,v)\) and \((v,u)\). At either state, the neighbors project bijectively to all edges of \(K_n\) incident to \(\{u,v\}\); thus (1) is a regular covering. For four distinct \(u,v,w,z\), the walk
\[
(u,v),(v,w),(z,v),(v,u)
\]
joins the states of a fiber. As \(L(K_n)\) is connected, the cover is connected. Line graphs preserve this covering and its deck quotient, proving (2). Ordered-pair and ordered-triple counting gives (4). \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (shared pointed binary lift).** For any connected regular two-sheeted graph cover \(\widetilde F\to F\) with deck involution \(\rho\), let \(H=L(F)=L(\widetilde F)/\rho\). Color the edges of \(\widetilde F\) by a function \(c\) with \(c(\rho e)=1+c(e)\). For incident cover edges \(e,f\), define the projected turn cochain
\[
d([\{e,f\}])=c(e)+c(f).\tag{5}
\]
If \(\alpha\) is the covering monodromy on the binary cycle space of \(H\), then the cochains arising in this way comprise the affine coset
\[
\boxed{d\in a+B^1(H;\mathbb F_2),\quad d(C)=\alpha(C)
\text{ for every binary cycle }C,}\tag{6}
\]
where \(a\) represents \(\alpha\). The coloring is reconstructed from \(d\) up to global color complementation. With \(B_H\) the binary incidence matrix, define the pointed binary matroid
\[
\boxed{D(F,\rho)=
M\left(\begin{array}{c|c}B_H&0\\a&1\end{array}\right)^*,}\tag{7}
\]
with distinguished element \(p\). Its binary cycles through \(p\) are \(X_d=\operatorname{supp}(d)\cup\{p\}\), while cocircuits through \(p\) are \(Y_C=C\cup\{p\}\) for odd-monodromy simple cycles \(C\) of \(H\). Their intersections satisfy
\[
|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+\sum_{e\in C}d(e)\equiv0\pmod2.\tag{8}
\]
In particular, boundary tournaments modulo global complementation correspond bijectively to the port-containing cycles of \(D_n^{\mathrm{BT}}=D(F_n,\rho)\), an affine space of dimension
\[
\boxed{n\binom{n-1}{2}-1.}\tag{9}
\]
Taking \(\widetilde F=Q_n\), \(F=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), recovers the pointed cube matroid of Article XI.

*Proof.* Equation (5) is unchanged when both incident edges are acted upon by \(\rho\). A closed walk in \(H\) lifts to a turn walk in \(L(\widetilde F)\) whose final edge is either the initial edge or its deck image; telescoping the color differences gives \(d(C)=\alpha(C)\). Choose a reference odd coloring \(c_0\), selecting one cover edge from each deck pair. Its turn cochain \(a_0\) has these same cycle sums. Hence every admissible \(d\) differs from \(a_0\) by a coboundary \(\delta f\). Lifting \(f\) to a deck-invariant edge function on \(\widetilde F\) produces \(c=c_0+f\); connectedness shows that global complementation is the sole ambiguity. The dual cycle space in (7) is the row space of the displayed matrix. A minimal dependence containing the port comprises the port and one simple cycle on which \(a\) has odd sum. These observations yield (8). Connectedness gives the cut-space dimension \(|V(H)|-1=|E(F)|-1\), proving (9). \(\square\)

**Theorem 3 (the short-port decoding obstruction).** For \(n\ge4\), the port cogirth of \(D_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\) is four:
\[
\boxed{g_p(D_n^{\mathrm{BT}})=4.}\tag{10}
\]
Its shortest port cocircuits correspond to the three-edge stars \(\{va,vb,vc\}\) of the original complete graph \(K_n\), with \(a,b,c,v\) distinct. Consequently *every* port-containing cycle \(X\) and *every* shortest port cocircuit \(Y\) satisfy
\[
\boxed{|X\cap Y|\in\{2,4\}.}\tag{11}
\]
Thus a universal four-intersection theorem for this pointed matroid says nothing about long vertex-simple monochromatic tight paths.

*Proof.* The three-step cover walk
\[
(a,v),(v,b),(c,v),(v,a)=\rho(a,v)
\]
projects to a triangle in \(F_n=L(K_n)\), on vertices \(\{va,vb,vc\}\), with nontrivial monodromy. Its three consecutive cover edges project to a monodromy-one turn triangle in \(H=L(F_n)\), producing a port cocircuit of size four. There are no shorter simple cycles in \(H\), proving (10). Every graph triangle in a line graph \(L(F)\) is either a triangle of edges incident at one vertex of \(F\) (whose lifted turn monodromy is zero), or the three consecutive edges of a triangle of \(F\). Triangles of \(F_n=L(K_n)\) themselves come from either three edges incident at one vertex of \(K_n\), with monodromy one, or the three edges of a triangle of \(K_n\), with monodromy zero: the latter lifts to the closed directed state path \((a,b),(b,c),(c,a),(a,b)\). This classifies the shortest port cocircuits. Binary cycle--cocircuit orthogonality makes their intersections even; since both sets contain \(p\), such an intersection is either two or four. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (local tournaments and two-intersection).** The shortest port cocircuit arising from the star \(\{va,vb,vc\}\) has intersection two with \(X_{d_b}\) if the restriction of the middle-local tournament at \(v\) to \(\{a,b,c\}\) is transitive, and intersection four if it is a directed three-cycle. In particular, for every \(n\ge5\), all port-containing cycles \(X\) have a *shortest* port cocircuit \(Y\) with
\[
\boxed{|X\cap Y|=2.}\tag{12}
\]
For \(n=4\), taking every middle-local tournament to be cyclic produces a port cycle whose intersection with every shortest port cocircuit is four.

*Proof.* Order \(a<b<c\) and set \(x=b(a,v,b)\), \(y=b(b,v,c)\), \(z=b(a,v,c)\). The corresponding cyclic turn word lifts from three cover edges colored \(x,1-y,1-z\), and its integer cyclic switch weight is
\[
w=[x=y]+[y\ne z]+[z\ne x].
\]
This equals three precisely when \(x=y\ne z\), the cyclic tournament, and one otherwise. Its port intersection is \(w+1\). Every tournament on at least four vertices contains a transitive triangle: choose a vertex with at least two outneighbors or at least two inneighbors. The local tournament has \(n-1\ge4\) vertices when \(n\ge5\). The cyclic choices at \(n=4\) are permitted independently at each center. \(\square\)

**Theorem 5 (the missing auxiliary graphic matroid).** A vertex tuple \(P=(v_1,\ldots,v_m)\), \(m\ge3\), determines a naturally directed path in \(S_n\) through states
\[
s_i=(v_i,v_{i+1})\quad(1\le i<m),
\]
whose \(m-2\) edges \(e_i=s_i s_{i+1}\) are colored
\(b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\). Let \(t_i\) be the turn of \(H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\) induced by \(e_i,e_{i+1}\). Then
\[
\boxed{d_b(t_i)=
b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})+
b(v_{i+1},v_{i+2},v_{i+3}).}\tag{13}
\]
The tuple \(P\) is vertex-simple precisely when its projected state set
\[
\{\{v_i,v_{i+1}\}:1\le i<m\}
\tag{14}
\]
is independent in the *graphic matroid* \(M(K_n)\), provided the cover path follows the natural orientations of all \(S_n\)-edges. Consequently the maximum length of a positive tight path in \(b\) is the maximum size of a naturally directed \(S_n\)-path whose projected state labels form an independent set in \(M(K_n)\) and whose induced \(H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\)-turn path has all turn labels zero.

*Proof.* Consecutive edges of the directed state path share the state \((v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\), proving (13). Its projected states are the consecutive edges of the original vertex walk in \(K_n\). A vertex-simple walk is a tree path and its edge set is graphic-independent. Conversely, a repeated original vertex in a nonbacktracking walk, as enforced by the state transitions, creates a closed subwalk of length at least three and hence a graphic cycle. Thus graphic independence is equivalent to vertex simplicity. An all-zero turn word makes all consecutive triple colors agree. If their common color is zero, reversal of the original tuple complements every triple color, yielding a positive tight path of the same length; therefore the maximum for positive words equals the maximum for arbitrary monochromatic words. \(\square\)

**Theorem 6 (shared short-cycle generation).** Let \(\widetilde F\to F\) be any regular connected two-cover, let \(H=L(F)\), and denote the monodromies by \(\beta\) on \(F\) and \(\alpha\) on \(H\). If \(T_H\) is the span of triangles inside vertex-star cliques of \(H\), then the incidence-subdivision turn map yields
\[
0\longrightarrow T_H\longrightarrow Z_1(H;\mathbb F_2)
\xrightarrow{\varphi}Z_1(F;\mathbb F_2)\longrightarrow0,
\qquad \alpha=\beta\circ\varphi.
\tag{15}
\]
In the boundary-tournament case, \(\ker\alpha\) is generated by (a) star triangles of \(H_n^{\mathrm{BT}}\), (b) turn triangles corresponding to three-edge triangles in \(K_n\), and (c) binary sums of two turn triangles corresponding to three-edge stars in \(K_n\). These generators have support cardinality at most six. In the cube case, the kernel is generated by star triangles and square turn cycles, as proved earlier in Article XI.

*Proof.* A turn between two \(F\)-edges incident at \(v\) maps to the sum of their two incident half-edges in the subdivision of \(F\). This gives a surjection of binary cycle spaces from \(H=L(F)\) onto \(F\). The kernel in each incident-edge clique is its graph cycle space, generated by triangles, proving (15). The covering monodromy tracks the lifted contact-vertex walk, so \(\alpha=\beta\circ\varphi\). Apply the same sequence to \(F_n=L(K_n)\). Its cycle space is generated by three-edge stars of \(K_n\) and three-edge triangles of \(K_n\), since the cycle space of \(K_n\) is triangle-generated. The first type has \(\beta=1\) and the second \(\beta=0\), by Theorem 3. Therefore \(\ker\beta\) is generated by the second type and binary sums of pairs of the first type. Lift these elements back through \(\varphi\), adding the star-triangle kernel \(T_H\), to obtain the asserted generators. The cube comparison follows from the previously established square-generation theorem. \(\square\)

**Research consequence.** Cube edge colorings and boundary tournaments share the same functorial pointed binary *line-graph cover lift*, the affine turn cohomology class, and bounded-support generators for its monodromy-zero cycles. But the boundary-tournament four-intersection property is automatic because its port cogirth is four. Long tight paths correspond instead to zero-turn paths satisfying coherent orientation and an independent-set condition in \(M(K_n)\). Accordingly, a common theorem strong enough to advance both problems needs the pointed matroid *decorated with a matroid-constrained path family*, rather than just its collection of shortest port cocircuits. This identifies a structural research direction; it does not assert the unresolved long-path or two-switch conjectures.

A connected two-sheeted cover of graphs induces a cover of their line graphs. Its monodromy cochain, together with a binary incidence matrix and one port column, defines a pointed binary lift matroid. Antisymmetric edge colorings upstairs correspond to port-containing binary cycles downstairs. The central witness problem is to find a resource-constrained path in the covering graph whose projected consecutive turns avoid the support of the selected cycle. The shared incidence representation is the pointed dual of the matrix (B 0; a 1), where B is the vertex-edge incidence matrix of the quotient line graph and a records covering monodromy. Every admissible signature is a+delta(f), and each port-containing binary cycle represents a deck-odd edge coloring up to global complement.

**Theorem (turn signature).** Let H=L(G) and B be its binary vertex-edge incidence matrix. Let a record monodromy of L(tilde G) over H. The pointed binary matroid D is dual to the matrix formed from B with a bottom row a and a new port column whose only nonzero entry is in that bottom row. An antisymmetric edge coloring c upstairs induces the turn signature d(ef)=c(e)+c(f) downstairs, and the corresponding port-containing cycle of D is support(d) together with the port. Every port-containing cycle arises from a cochain \(a+\delta f\). If a path \(P\) of \(\widetilde G\) has consecutive edges \(e_1,\ldots,e_m\) whose projected turns are distinct, denote their set by \(F(P)\). Then
\[
\boxed{\operatorname{sw}_c(P)=|F(P)\cap X_d|.}
\]
*Proof.* Color differences telescope along lifts of cycles of \(H\), giving the covering monodromy. This proves \(d\in a+B^1(H)\); lifting any such cochain constructs an odd coloring unique modulo complement. The port cycles are the row vectors \((a+\delta f,1)\) of the primal matrix. Each projected turn contributes one precisely when its successive edge colors differ. \(\square\)

**Cube instance.** The antipodal two-cover Q_n over its folded quotient gives the pointed dual D_n. Geodesics use every direction once, and zero intersection with the corresponding turn signature means the geodesic is monochromatic.

**Boundary-tournament instance.** Let G=L(K_V). Let S_V have ordered-pair vertices (u,v), with an edge from (u,v) to (v,w) for distinct u,v,w; retain those edges without directions. The map (u,v) to the unordered pair {u,v} is a regular two-cover S_V to L(K_V), with deck involution (u,v) to (v,u). Hence the quotient turn graph is L(L(K_V)). The edge (u,v)-(v,w) represents the ordered triple (u,v,w); its deck translate represents (w,v,u). A reversal-odd boundary tournament is therefore an antisymmetric edge coloring of this covering graph.

An injective word (v_1,...,v_k) of original vertices yields the forward path (v_1,v_2),(v_2,v_3),...,(v_{k-1},v_k) in S_V. Its successive edge colors are precisely the boundary labels b(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2}), and the projected consecutive turns are pairwise distinct. Thus the same zero-intersection condition produces a monochromatic vertex-simple tight path, provided that the selected walk respects the forward-overlap rule and original-vertex injectivity. These conditions are not encoded by a cocircuit of the underlying pointed binary matroid.

**Resource-window extension.** A signed line-cover matroid may be decorated by a finite resource set R and ordered labels omega(e) on covering edges. Each label is a tuple of distinct resources, and omega(tau e) is its reversal. The admissible paths are those whose labels overlap as consecutive windows of a single injective resource word. This path language is not determined by the binary matroid.

**Common witness predicate.** For a marked path P, let F(P) be its projected turn set. Given an integer demand m, define U_m to mean: for every port-containing binary cycle X there exists a marked path P whose resource word has at least m distinct letters and for which F(P) is disjoint from X. Theorem 1 proves that U_m means existence of a monochromatic path using at least m resources.

**Permutation-complete window systems.** Fix n resources and a width k. A window system is called permutation-complete when every permutation of the resources is realized by a marked path (with an allowed starting root), reversing that permutation gives the deck-translated reversal of its edge sequence, and exchanging adjacent resources changes at most k+1 consecutive edge states. The cube is a width-one system, with edge labels equal to coordinate directions. The boundary ordered-pair graph is a width-three system, with edge labels equal to ordered triples of original vertices.

**Conjecture.** Homogeneous complete resource-window covers have the zero-intersection selector property at full resource length for width one and at a positive linear fraction of the resource count for width three, under the further condition that the ordered triple determines its covering edge. Here homogeneous means that the full permutation group on the resources acts through automorphisms of the graph covering, compatibly with the window labels, and that the group acts transitively on feasible directed local turns. The preceding conjecture is an unproved candidate for this more restrictive class; its validity on arbitrary intermediate covers has not been established. In particular, the acting automorphism group may have a root-moving kernel: it must project onto the resource symmetric group and act transitively on local turns, but the resource subgroup alone need not be transitive. Cube translations provide the kernel.

### Polarized matroid basis exchanges, twisted resource galleries, and the unified conjecture

This Subsection strengthens the common signed-cover representation already established in Article XI. Both NORI1 and ordinary reversal-odd boundary 3-tournaments admit the same *kind* of pointed binary matroid, but the boundary model requires a distinguished family of **long, resource-simple, alternating-port cocircuits**, not just shortest port cocircuits. We give axioms, canonical embeddings, a twisted-closing theorem, a seam-weight theorem, a quantitative conjecture, and reproducible finite obstructions.

#### 1. Common basis-exchange geometry

Let \(\Gamma(M)\) be the graph of bases of a matroid \(M\), joining bases related by one exchange.

**Theorem 1.** We have
\[
\boxed{\Gamma(\bigoplus_{i=1}^nU_{1,2})\cong Q_n,\qquad
\Gamma(U_{2,n})\cong J(n,2)=L(K_n).}
\tag{1}
\]
NORI1 colors unoriented edges of the first basis graph, with antipodal edges complementary. An ordinary boundary 3-tournament colors oriented edges of the second basis graph: the oriented exchange \(\{a,b\}\to\{b,c\}\) is the triple \((a,b,c)\), and its reversal obeys
\[
b(c,b,a)=1+b(a,b,c).
\tag{2}
\]

*Proof.* A basis of \(\bigoplus U_{1,2}\) chooses one element of each two-element summand; exchanging that element toggles one binary coordinate. A basis of \(U_{2,n}\) is an unordered pair, and adjacent pairs overlap in one element. Reversing an exchange of overlapping pairs reverses its ordered triple, establishing (2). \(\square\)

A legal boundary turn between two oriented exchanges has the **alternating-port** form
\[
(a,b,c)\longrightarrow(b,c,d),
\tag{3}
\]
with \(a,b,c,d\) pairwise distinct. At the intermediate basis \(\{b,c\}\), the incoming and outgoing ports differ. This property and the freshness of all original vertices are not consequences of arbitrary walk adjacency in a line graph.

#### 2. Five shared axioms

A **polarized exchange-gallery system**, with \(n\) resources and seam width \(q\in\{1,3\}\), consists of the following data.

**A1 (elementary basis-exchange states).** Its primitive colored states are specified oriented or unoriented elementary exchange edges of a matroid basis graph \(\Gamma(M)\). Its transition graph \(\widetilde H\) permits compatible consecutive exchanges, subject to nonbacktracking and alternating-port conditions.

**A2 (resource-simple permutation galleries).** There is an \(n\)-element resource alphabet \(R\). Every permutation of \(R\), perhaps with a starting root, indexes a complete gallery. A legal gallery or subgallery never repeats an original resource. This distinctness is retained when a gallery is decoded to the original model.

**A3 (reversal polarization).** The connected state graph \(\widetilde H\) admits a free involution \(J\), free also on transition edges, yielding a connected two-cover \(\widetilde H\to H=\widetilde H/J\). All state colorings satisfy \(c(Js)=1+c(s)\). If \(B_H\) is the binary graph-incidence matrix and \(a\) represents the covering-monodromy functional, define
\[
\boxed{D=M\begin{pmatrix}B_H&0\\a&1\end{pmatrix}^{*},\qquad
X_c=\operatorname{supp}(a+\delta f)\cup\{p\}.}
\tag{4}
\]
As in the preceding Subsections, the \(X_c\) are precisely the binary cycles of \(D\) containing its distinguished port \(p\), and port cocircuits are simple odd-monodromy cycles of \(H\), adjoined with \(p\).

**A4 (bounded twisted closure).** Each complete gallery on all \(n\) resources has \(n-q\) ordinary transitions and a continuation of \(q\) transitions from its last state to the involute of its initial state. The projected closed walk is a simple monodromy-one cycle of length \(n\). Any shorter \(m\)-resource gallery declared *sealable* has an analogous length-\(m\) simple closing cycle. Denote the associated family of size-\(m+1\) port cocircuits by \(\mathcal F_m\). These need not be shortest among all port cocircuits.

**A5 (local Coxeter exchanges).** Swapping adjacent resource positions changes only boundedly many states and turns, independently of \(n\). Disjoint swaps commute; resource-permutation indices satisfy braid relations; the uncolored family is invariant under relabeling resources.

A1–A5 are shared structural conditions, not a theorem asserting small cycle–cocircuit intersection. In particular, an involution and reversal-oddness alone would permit the higher-face counterexamples in Article I. The requirement that *colored primitive states be elementary one-dimensional exchanges* excludes their canonical higher-face representation, without excluding every conceivable alternative encoding.

**Proposition 2 (the two embeddings).** For \(n\ge6\), both canonical models satisfy A1–A5. In the cube model take \(M=\bigoplus U_{1,2}\), \(\widetilde H=L(Q_n)\), \(J\) induced by antipodal complementation, and \(q=1\). In the boundary model take \(M=U_{2,n}\), the graph on ordered-triple states with alternating-port transitions (3), reversal \(J(a,b,c)=(c,b,a)\), and \(q=3\).

*Proof.* A full cube geodesic has \(n\) edge states and \(n-1\) turns. The last state meets the antipode of the initial state in one further turn. Adjacent direction swaps replace a local square route. For the boundary model, the ordered-triple overlap graph is connected for \(n\ge5\): two steps change either extreme symbol while retaining the middle symbol, and one step can change the middle symbol. Reversal acts freely on the states and their edges. A full injective ordering has \(n-2\) consecutive triple states and \(n-3\) ordinary transitions. The three closing turns are constructed below. Adjacent vertex swaps alter a bounded number of neighboring three-letter windows. Both models admit all resource permutations and all legal polarized state colorings. \(\square\)

The boundary overlap graph here is a restricted alternating-port subgraph of the full line graph of the oriented-pair cover of the preceding boundary-tournament Subsection. That larger pointed matroid has port cogirth four, making four-intersection with a shortest cocircuit automatic but uninformative for long paths. A4 instead remembers the distinguished *long* closing cocircuits.

#### 3. Three-turn closure and long port cocircuits

**Theorem 3 (simple twisted closure).** Let \(v=(v_1,\ldots,v_m)\) be an injective word of length \(m\ge6\) in an ordinary boundary tournament. Set
\[
t_i=(v_i,v_{i+1},v_{i+2})\quad(1\le i\le m-2),\qquad
s_1=(v_{m-1},v_m,v_3),\quad s_2=(v_m,v_3,v_2).
\tag{5}
\]
Then
\[
\boxed{t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_{m-2},s_1,s_2,Jt_1}
\tag{6}
\]
is a state path of length \(m\) from \(t_1\) to \(Jt_1\). Its quotient is a simple cycle \(C_v\) with covering monodromy one, so
\[
\boxed{Y_v=C_v\cup\{p\}\text{ is a port cocircuit of size }m+1.}
\tag{7}
\]
The first \(m-3\) turns compare the original consecutive triple colors; the final three are closing seams.

*Proof.* Adjacent states in (6) overlap in the required ordered pair and use four distinct original vertices, by injectivity and \(m\ge6\). The ordinary states have distinct three-element supports consisting of successive triples of the injective word. The extra supports \(\{v_{m-1},v_m,v_3\}\) and \(\{v_m,v_3,v_2\}\) are distinct from one another and all successive triple supports. Hence their reversal-orbits are distinct from the earlier ones. The final state is \(Jt_1\), so its projection closes the cycle while the lift changes sheets. The cycle is simple and has monodromy one, giving the stated cocircuit by (4). \(\square\)

**Theorem 4 (seam-weight identity and decoding).** For any polarized system satisfying A3–A4, any sealable gallery \(\gamma\) with closing cocircuit \(Y_\gamma\in\mathcal F_m\), and any port cycle \(X_c\), let \(s(\gamma)\) denote the number of changes among the gallery's internal state colors. There exists \(h_\gamma\in\{0,\ldots,q\}\) such that
\[
\boxed{|X_c\cap Y_\gamma|-1=s(\gamma)+h_\gamma,\qquad
|X_c\cap Y_\gamma|\equiv0\pmod2,}
\tag{8}
\]
whence
\[
\boxed{\max(0,|X_c\cap Y_\gamma|-1-q)
\le s(\gamma)\le|X_c\cap Y_\gamma|-1.}
\tag{9}
\]
For the cube \(q=1\), intersection two on a complete gallery guarantees a monochromatic full antipodal geodesic by cyclic root rotation. For the boundary case \(q=3\), intersection at most four along a sealed \(m\)-vertex word guarantees a monochromatic vertex-simple tight subpath of order at least
\[
\boxed{\left\lceil\frac{m-2}{4}\right\rceil+2.}
\tag{10}
\]

*Proof.* The integer turn weight around the closed cycle is the sum of the \(s(\gamma)\) internal comparisons and the \(h_\gamma\le q\) closing comparisons, and the shared port adds one intersection element. Monodromy-one parity makes the intersection even. In the cube, a cyclic turn word with one changed turn can be cut at that change, yielding a full monochromatic geodesic. In the boundary model, at most three internal changes partition the \(m-2\) successive triple colors into at most four constant runs. A largest run contains at least \(\lceil(m-2)/4\rceil\) triples and therefore has two more original vertices, still pairwise distinct. \(\square\)

#### 4. The shared quantitative conjecture

**Conjecture 5 (seam-controlled gallery intersection).** In a homogeneous polarized exchange-gallery system satisfying A1–A5, with \(n\) resources, seam width \(q\in\{1,3\}\), and its decorated pointed matroid \((D,p,\{\mathcal F_m\})\), every binary cycle \(X\in Z(D)\) containing \(p\) meets a distinguished cocircuit \(Y\in\mathcal F_m\) satisfying
\[
\boxed{m\ge\left\lceil n^{\,2/(q+1)}\right\rceil,
\qquad |X\cap Y|\le q+1;}
\tag{11}
\]
for \(q=3\), require also \(m\ge6\).

**Conditional consequence.** This one assertion implies both (i) unrestricted monochromatic NORI1 and (ii) a vertex-simple monochromatic tight path of length \(\Omega(\sqrt n)\) in every ordinary boundary 3-tournament.

*Proof.* For the cube, \(q=1\) forces \(m\ge n\), hence a full gallery; intersection at most two invokes Theorem 4. For a boundary tournament, \(q=3\) forces \(m\ge\sqrt n\); intersection at most four and (10) give the stated simple tight path. \(\square\)

The exponent in (11) is proposed rather than derived. A1–A5 might require a further intrinsic rank or exchange-compatibility hypothesis for (11) to hold across *all* matroids. A refutation of this broader conjecture outside the two canonical systems would locate that missing hypothesis. The distinction between a decorated resource-simple witness family and shortest port cocircuits is essential.

#### 5. Two six-vertex obstructions

Let \(V=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\). Index the 60 ordered-triple reversal pairs by increasing middle vertex \(b\), then by lexicographically increasing outer pair \(a<c\) disjoint from \(b\). Define a reversal-odd coloring \(b_M(a,b,c)\) by the corresponding bit of an integer mask \(M\) if \(a<c\), and the complementary bit if \(a>c\).

For every permutation \(v=(v_1,\ldots,v_6)\), construct the six triple states in (6), evaluate their colors \(w_1,\ldots,w_6\), and compute the closing cycle turn weight
\[
W_M(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{5}[w_i\ne w_{i+1}]+[w_6=w_1].
\tag{12}
\]
The equality comparison at the end represents the reversal of the initial triple. The corresponding port intersection is \(W_M(v)+1\).

**Proposition 6 (the two-intersection threshold fails).** For
\[
\boxed{M_1=\mathrm{0x6c08f53c2725f48},}
\tag{13}
\]
the complete enumeration of all 720 full vertex permutations gives the twisted-weight histogram
\[
\boxed{W=1:0,\qquad W=3:360,\qquad W=5:360.}
\tag{14}
\]
Thus no full-resource sealed cocircuit from Theorem 3 intersects the corresponding port cycle in two elements. The cube's two-intersection target does not transfer unchanged to the boundary model.

A second mask
\[
\boxed{M_2=\mathrm{0xc047a05436d6c6e}}
\tag{15}
\]
gives \(W=1:0\), \(W=3:264\), \(W=5:456\), and **no spanning monochromatic tight word** among the 720 permutations. Hence the common conclusion cannot require a full spanning monochromatic boundary path.

*Proof (exhaustive finite verification).* Choose all 60 triple representatives by the indexing convention above. For each of the 720 permutations, calculate the four ordinary consecutive triple colors, then the two closing triple colors from (5). The six colors determine the five ordinary adjacent comparisons and the final equality comparison in (12). Independently count a full monochromatic word when its first four triple colors agree. A Python standard-library implementation enumerating combinations, permutations and these comparisons was executed and returned
\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}
\text{mask}&W=1&W=3&W=5&\text{full monochromatic words}\\\hline
M_1&0&360&360&2\\
M_2&0&264&456&0
\end{array}
\]
with all row totals 720. The 60-bit masks and the completely specified enumeration rule give reproducible finite certificates. \(\square\)

#### 6. Scope and relation to Article XI

The shared object is a **decorated pointed binary matroid arising from a polarized one-dimensional basis-exchange cover**, with an admissible resource-simple path family and bounded twisted closing seams. This formulation simultaneously retains (a) NORI1's full coordinate-distinct geodesics, (b) the boundary model's coherent ordered-triple overlaps and vertex simplicity, (c) adjacent-exchange structure, and (d) the integer turn-intersection identity. The graphic-matroid independence criterion for boundary tight paths proved in the preceding Subsection is an alternative way to enforce original vertex simplicity.

Theorem 1, Proposition 2, Theorems 3–4, and Proposition 6 are established results. Conjecture 5 remains open and must not be presented as a consequence of the axioms. Its proposed seam-dependent intersection threshold and resource scale are justified as a common target by the decoding theorem and the finite obstructions; proving a corresponding general theorem or finding the missing strengthening of A1–A5 is the next research problem.

### Unified matroid conjectures: common axioms, implications, and obstructions

This Subsection assembles the Article XI exploration of generalized binary matroid intersection properties and the comparison with reversal-odd boundary 3-tournaments. The goal is an abstract theorem implying **both** unrestricted monochromatic NORI1 and a long vertex-simple monochromatic boundary-tournament tight path. It separates established facts from proposed conjectures; none of the proposed universal intersection implications below has been proved.

#### A. The shared pointed line-graph double cover

For any connected regular two-cover \(\widetilde F\to F\) with deck involution \(\rho\), put \(H=L(F)=L(\widetilde F)/\rho\). Let \(B_H\) be the binary incidence matrix and \(a\) a binary cochain representing covering monodromy. The *pointed lift dual*
\[
\boxed{D=M\begin{pmatrix}B_H&0\\a&1\end{pmatrix}^{*}}\tag{1}
\]
has a distinguished element \(p\). Every deck-odd edge coloring of the cover, \(c(\rho e)=1+c(e)\), induces a turn cochain \(d([\{e,f\}])=c(e)+c(f)\) on \(H\), and the allowed signatures comprise the single affine switching class \(a+B^1(H;\mathbb F_2)\). The corresponding binary cycle is \(X_d=\operatorname{supp}(d)\cup\{p\}\). Conversely every port-containing binary cycle determines a coloring up to global complement. Port-containing cocircuits are \(Y_C=C\cup\{p\}\), with \(C\) a simple monodromy-one cycle in \(H\), and
\[
\boxed{|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+\sum_{t\in C}d(t),}\tag{2}
\]
with the sum on the right taken as an integer. These statements are proved in the foundational Subsections.

For the cube take \(\widetilde F=Q_n\), \(F=Q_n/\tau\), and write \(D_n\) for (1). Its shortest port cocircuits have \(|Y|=n+1\) and correspond to full antipodal geodesics. The unrestricted two-switch conjecture says that every port cycle intersects one of these shortest cocircuits in at most four elements. The monochromatic NORI1 conjecture requires intersection two.

For an ordinary boundary tournament take \(\widetilde F=S_n\), the graph of ordered pairs \((u,v)\) with transitions \((u,v)\sim(v,w)\), with deck action \((u,v)\mapsto(v,u)\) and quotient \(F=L(K_n)\). The reversal-odd triple color \(b(u,v,w)=1+b(w,v,u)\) is the deck-odd edge color of that transition. The quotient turn graph is \(H_n^{\rm BT}=L^2(K_n)\), and (1)--(2) yield a pointed binary matroid \(D_n^{\rm BT}\) and a bijection between its port cycles and tournament colorings up to complement.

**Essential asymmetry (theorem):**
\[
\boxed{g_p(D_n)=n+1,\qquad g_p(D_n^{\rm BT})=4.}\tag{3}
\]
In the tournament case the shortest port cocircuits are local star triangles. Every port cycle intersects each in two or four elements, and for \(n\ge5\) a transitive three-vertex local subtournament gives an intersection of two. Therefore an intersection conjecture restricted to *shortest* port cocircuits is automatically satisfied by the tournament and cannot imply long monochromatic tight paths.

#### B. The stronger shared structure: polarized resource galleries

The useful common structure extends beyond the pointed binary matroid itself:

**S1 (polarization).** A connected two-cover of a transition/state graph, with a free involution, a deck-odd coloring of elementary one-dimensional exchange states, and the affine port-cycle correspondence (1).

**S2 (small balanced relations).** The monodromy-zero cycle space of the quotient turn graph is generated by local bounded-support relations. The cube has star triangles and square turns. The tournament has star triangles, triangle turns, and binary sums of paired local triangle turns, with support at most six. These bounds are independent of the size of the underlying instance.

**S3 (resource independence).** Legal witness galleries respect an auxiliary matroid. For the cube, the relevant resource matroid is the partition matroid on coordinate directions; a full antipodal geodesic uses each coordinate once. For boundary tournaments, a coherent state path reads an original vertex word \(v_1,\ldots,v_m\); its projected ordered-pair resources \(\{v_i,v_{i+1}\}\) must be independent in the graphic matroid \(M(K_n)\). Along with the forward-overlap rule, this is equivalent to vertex simplicity.

**S4 (bounded local basis exchanges).** Adjacent transpositions of coordinate directions or of original vertices change only bounded local parts of the corresponding gallery. The exchanges generate connected permutation galleries and satisfy the usual local Coxeter relations, subject to maintaining coherent orientation and resource independence.

**S5 (bounded twisted closing seam).** Sealable galleries can be prolonged to the involute of their first state in \(q\) additional turns, producing marked monodromy-one cycles and cocircuits. On the cube \(q=1\), and the marked full-gallery cocircuits are the *shortest* port cocircuits. In the tournament \(q=3\), and an injective word of \(m\ge6\) vertices has an explicit three-turn closure giving a marked port cocircuit of size \(m+1\), generally much longer than the shortest cocircuit.

The natural setting for S1--S5 is the basis-exchange graph of a matroid together with a reversal polarization. The cube is the basis graph of \(\bigoplus_{i=1}^nU_{1,2}\), whereas \(L(K_n)=J(n,2)\) is the basis graph of \(U_{2,n}\). Their compatible one-dimensional exchanges lead to the two cover constructions. It is the **decorated pointed binary lift plus its independent coherent path language** that might satisfy a common theorem, not the undecorated pointed matroid.

#### C. Abstract intersection conjectures at different strengths

For finite pointed binary \((M,p)\), let \(Z(M)\) be its binary cycle space and
\[
g_p(M)=\min\{|Y|:Y\in\mathcal C^*(M),\ p\in Y\},\quad
\mathcal Y_p=\{Y\in\mathcal C^*(M):p\in Y,\ |Y|=g_p(M)\}.
\tag{4}
\]
Let \(P_b(M,p)\) require, for every port-containing binary cycle \(X\), a *shortest* port cocircuit \(Y\in\mathcal Y_p\) satisfying \(|X\cap Y|\le b\). Let \(\mathrm{PI}_2(M,p)\) be the weaker requirement of intersection two with *some* port cocircuit, which may be long.

**Conjecture A (abstract short-port amplification).** If \(M\setminus p\) is cographic, its balanced cycle space admits bounded-size generators, its shortest port cocircuits form a connected bounded-exchange graph, and \(\mathrm{PI}_2(M,p)\) holds, then \(P_4(M,p)\) holds. A specific earlier proposal required local generators of size three or four and \(|Y\triangle Y'|\le6\) along edges of the exchange graph. The bolder version drops local generation and exchange connectivity and assumes only binary representability, cographic deletion and \(\mathrm{PI}_2\). Both formulations remain open; neither can by itself encode the boundary long-path target.

For cube \(D_n\), Wu--Yang's 2026 proof of the nongeodesic monochromatic antipodal-path theorem, together with the Article XI odd-girth reduction, establishes \(\mathrm{PI}_2\). The minimum port cocircuits form a connected exchange graph and their even intersection values have no gaps. These are all-dimensional theorems. They do not yet bound the *minimum* intersection by four. The nongeodesic two-intersection witness can have large cocircuit cardinality.

**Conjecture B (seam-controlled marked-gallery intersection).** Let \(\mathscr G\) be a homogeneous polarized basis-exchange-gallery system on \(n\) resources satisfying S1--S5, with seam width \(q\in\{1,3\}\), pointed lift \(D\), and distinguished family \(\mathcal F_m\) of port cocircuits produced by sealable, resource-independent galleries on \(m\) resources. Conjecture that for each \(X\in Z(D)\) containing \(p\), there are \(m\) and \(Y\in\mathcal F_m\) such that
\[
\boxed{m\ge\left\lceil n^{2/(q+1)}\right\rceil,\qquad |X\cap Y|\le q+1,}\tag{5}
\]
with the boundary case additionally taking \(m\ge6\), where the published closing construction applies. The exponent and possible sufficiency of S1--S5 are conjectural. Additional structural rank/exchange hypotheses may be needed.

For such a closing witness the proved seam-count identity is
\[
\boxed{|X\cap Y_\gamma|-1=\operatorname{sw}(\gamma)+h_\gamma,\qquad 0\le h_\gamma\le q.}\tag{6}
\]
If \(q=1\), (5) supplies a full \(n\)-resource cube gallery with cyclic turn weight at most one; cyclic rotation produces a full monochromatic antipodal geodesic, establishing unrestricted NORI1. If \(q=3\), it supplies an injective boundary word with \(m\ge\sqrt n\) vertices and at most three internal changes among its \(m-2\) triple colors. The longest of at most four constant runs then supplies a vertex-simple monochromatic tight path with at least
\[
\boxed{\left\lceil\frac{m-2}{4}\right\rceil+2=\Omega(\sqrt n)}\tag{7}
\]
original vertices. Thus (5) would resolve the two target problems simultaneously. This is a *conditional implication*, not a proof of (5).

**Conjecture C (independence-preserving exchange and rank growth).** Seek a local, color-cost-controlled exchange operation acting on galleries or marked cocircuits that preserves the appropriate auxiliary resource matroid and legal transition language. It should remove repeated-resource excess or increase the independent resource rank without growing \(|X\cap Y|\) beyond the appropriate seam budget. In the cube, the obstacle is an extra coordinate traversal in a low-weight monodromy-one cycle; in the boundary model, the obstacle is extending a zero-turn directed tight path without repeating an original vertex. A sufficiently strong iterative rank-growth or defect-reduction lemma would lead to Conjecture B. The desired operation must be expressed in local basis/circuit language without assuming the sought low-intersection witness.

The direct equivalent research target deletes the disagreeing turns \(\operatorname{supp}(X)\setminus\{p\}\) from the quotient turn graph and asks for a long **resource-independent coherent zero-turn gallery**. The closure formulation (5)--(6) instead allows a bounded number of nonzero turns and extracts a long zero-turn subgallery.

#### D. Noncubical matroids already reached by contraction

Another Subsection of this Section proves a broader class by starting from a simple pointed binary matroid \((N,t)\), with \(t\) spanned by a set of distinct nonzero binary generators \(S\). The Cayley graph \(\operatorname{Cay}(\mathbb F_2^r,S)\), with involution translating by \(t\), produces a pointed signed-cover matroid \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\). If the shortest circuit of \(N\) through \(t\) has size \(q\), the new matroid has port cogirth \(q\) and admits a port-cogirth-preserving contraction onto \(D_{q-1}\). The established contraction-inheritance theorem transfers \(P_b\) for \(b=2,4\) from this cube matroid to \(\mathfrak D(N,t)\). This generalization is equivalent to the all-dimensional cube assertion, since cube matroids occur inside it. It gives noncubical examples, but does not subsume the tournament's long directed path language.

#### E. Counterexamples showing why the decorations matter

The signed odd five-cycle yields a binary pointed dual \(M=U_{1,6}\) with cographic deletion whose ground-set cycle and only cocircuit intersect in six elements; binary/cographic hypotheses alone do not imply \(P_4\). Signed theta examples show that bounded local generators and connected shortest-cocircuit exchanges also do not suffice in the absence of the unrestricted two-intersection premise.

The tope graph \(C_{10}\square Q_k\) admits an antipodally odd edge coloring forcing four changes along every antipodal geodesic for arbitrarily large \(k\). Therefore all antipodal partial cubes, all oriented-matroid tope graphs, and high rank alone form overly broad classes. Pairwise square crossing of coordinate directions was proposed as a possible stronger geometric restriction; its sufficiency is unknown.

For the boundary cover, shortest port cogirth is four, so the four-intersection problem is trivial even though the long monochromatic tight-path problem remains difficult. A published six-vertex mask demonstrates that two-intersection can fail across *all full-length marked boundary closure cocircuits*; a second mask prevents a monochromatic spanning tight word. These rule out stronger seam conjectures requiring two-intersection for every full boundary gallery or a spanning monochromatic boundary path. The four-intersection and square-root resource targets in (5) survive these tests.

Earlier higher-face reversal-odd counterexamples demonstrate that reversal oddness and pointed binary representability alone cannot enforce the required long path. Insistence on elementary one-dimensional exchange states and an independent-resource path language is therefore substantive, although it remains to be tested whether S1--S5 are strong enough outside the canonical models.

#### F. Program for finding the missing shared hypothesis

The main missing property is a **rank-preserving, independence-preserving local splice** compatible with signed monodromy, resource orientation and short local balanced relations. A viable hypothesis must be stated without using the desired global intersection conclusion as an assumption. Search for such a splice through basis-exchange squares, local star triangles, ordered-window exchanges, and their resulting endpoint carriers.

Test Conjecture A on small noncubical signed-graphic lifts that satisfy \(\mathrm{PI}_2\), not merely lifts with short generating cycles. Test Conjecture B on other basis-exchange graphs and oriented-matroid systems, always recording port intersection, cocircuit length, independent resource rank, admissible orientation and seam count. Test whether a monotone surgery for repeated cube-coordinate traversals has an analogue that extends boundary paths through fresh vertices. Bounded adjacent-swap exchange and the parity of signed local generators provide the most promising common algebra.

**Epistemic boundary.** The pointed lift representation, affine coset, local-generator facts, shortest-cogirth distinction, seam identity, contraction inheritance and specified counterexamples are established elsewhere in Article XI. Conjectures A--C and the resource bound (5) are open. The goal is not a matroid theorem already satisfied by the short local tournament cocircuits, but a theorem about a **decorated pointed matroid and its marked matroid-independent gallery family** capable of proving both NORI1 and long boundary-tournament paths.

### A canonical second port: orientation curvature and coherent galleries

Let \(\widetilde F\to F\) be a connected regular two-sheeted cover of finite connected simple graphs with deck involution \(\rho\). Assume \(F\) has a vertex of degree at least three, and put \(H=L(F)=L(\widetilde F)/\rho\). Article XI already defines the binary monodromy cochain \(a\), the pointed dual lift, and the color-dependent turn-signature class. The following new cohomology class is intrinsic to the same cover and distinguishes different *types of path closure*.

**Definition.** Orient the edges of \(\widetilde F\) so that \(\rho\) reverses their orientations. This can always be arranged because the deck action is free on edge orbits. For a quotient turn \(t\in E(H)\), choose incident lifted edges \(e,f\) meeting at a state \(v\). Define
\[
\lambda(t)=0\quad\text{if one edge enters and the other leaves }v,\qquad
\lambda(t)=1\quad\text{if both enter or both leave }v.
\tag{1}
\]
Reversing both orientations under \(\rho\) preserves this label, so \(\lambda\) is a cochain on \(H\).

**Theorem 1 (canonical orientation-curvature class).** Its class \([\lambda]\) modulo the cut space of \(H\) does not depend on which anti-equivariant orientations were chosen. For every star triangle \(T\) in \(H\), corresponding to three edges of \(F\) incident at one vertex,
\[
\boxed{\alpha(T)=0,\qquad\lambda(T)=1.}\tag{2}
\]
Consequently \([\lambda]\) and covering monodromy \([a]\) are independent binary cohomology classes.

*Proof.* Reorienting a deck-orbit of cover edges toggles the sense at every incident turn and therefore adds the vertex cut in \(H\) supported at the orbit corresponding to that vertex of \(H\). All reorientations act by sums of such cuts. A star triangle lifts to three cover edges meeting at one vertex, hence has monodromy zero. If the three incidence senses are \(b_1,b_2,b_3\), its curvature labels are \(1+b_1+b_2\), \(1+b_2+b_3\), and \(1+b_3+b_1\), summing to one over \(\mathbb F_2\). Since the cover is connected, monodromy is nonzero on some cycle, while the star triangle separates \([\lambda]\) from both zero and \([a]\). \(\square\)

**Theorem 2 (stationary-contact parity identity).** Let \(C\) be a simple cycle of \(H\), of length \(r\), and lift it to cover edges \(e_1,\ldots,e_r,e_{r+1}=\rho^\varepsilon e_1\), where \(\varepsilon=\alpha(C)\). Let \(v_i\) be the contact vertex of \(e_i,e_{i+1}\), and \(v_0=\rho^\varepsilon v_r\). Define \(s(C)=|\{i:v_{i-1}=v_i\}|\). Then
\[
\boxed{\lambda(C)\equiv\alpha(C)+s(C)\pmod2.}\tag{3}
\]
In particular a monodromy-one cycle with no stationary contact has curvature one, while a monodromy-one cycle built entirely from coherently directed transitions, all labeled \(\lambda=0\), has an odd number of stationary contacts.

*Proof.* For an oriented cover edge \(e\) and its incident vertex \(v\), set \(h(e,v)=1\) if \(v\) is the head of \(e\) and zero if it is the tail. The turn at \(v_i\) has
\[
\lambda_i=1+h(e_i,v_i)+h(e_{i+1},v_i).
\]
Sum over \(i\). The seam contributes \(\varepsilon\), because the orientation of \(\rho^\varepsilon e_1\) is the reversal of that of \(e_1\) when \(\varepsilon=1\). Each internal cover edge contributes one when its two contact vertices are different, and zero when they coincide. Thus
\[
\lambda(C)\equiv r+\varepsilon+(r-s(C))
\equiv\varepsilon+s(C)\pmod2.
\]
\(\square\)

**Theorem 3 (choice-free two-port lift).** Add distinguished columns \(p,q\), and put
\[
\boxed{\widehat M^{(2)}=
M\left(\begin{array}{c|cc}B_H&0&0\\
a&1&0\\ \lambda&0&1
\end{array}\right).}\tag{4}
\]
With its ordered pair of ports, this represented binary matroid is independent of cochain representatives and of anti-equivariant orientation choices. Its rank is \(|V(H)|+1\). Every simple graph cycle \(C\) gives a circuit
\[
\boxed{C\cup\bigl(\{p\}\text{ if }\alpha(C)=1\bigr)
\cup\bigl(\{q\}\text{ if }\lambda(C)=1\bigr).}\tag{5}
\]
The four signature sectors \((\alpha,\lambda)\in\mathbb F_2^2\) are consequently intrinsic.

*Proof.* Altering either cochain by a cut performs row operations on (4), so it leaves the represented matroid unchanged. The two cohomology classes are independent by Theorem 1, and \(B_H\) has rank \(|V(H)|-1\), giving the rank. The columns of a simple cycle sum to zero in the incidence rows and to \((\alpha(C),\lambda(C))\) in the bottom two rows; adjoining the specified port columns gives a dependence. Every proper nonempty subset of a simple cycle has nonzero incidence boundary, and the port columns are independent, so the dependence is minimal. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (cube and boundary paths occupy different phases).** A full antipodal cube geodesic has \((\alpha,\lambda)=(1,1)\) because its lifted consecutive edge contacts are all moving. A naturally directed boundary-tournament gallery from an ordered triple state \(t\) to its reversal \(\rho t\) has \((\alpha,\lambda)=(1,0)\), since all its consecutive directed turns have opposite incidence senses. The spurious minimum-port boundary star triangles have \((\alpha,\lambda)=(1,1)\), and hence lie in the opposite phase from coherent directed tournament galleries. This distinction is preserved by the two-port matroid.

**Theorem 5 (minimum coherent closing length and repeated resources).** In the ordered-pair boundary cover, a naturally directed sequence of triple-edge states beginning with \((a,b,c)\) and ending with its reversal \((c,b,a)\) must contain at least five directed turns. Five suffice, using four distinct original vertices \(a,b,c,d\):
\[
(a,b,c),(b,c,a),(c,a,d),(a,d,c),(d,c,b),(c,b,a).
\tag{6}
\]
Its first five reversal-orbits are distinct, so it yields a simple monodromy-one cycle of length five. Nevertheless the underlying original vertex word
\[
a,b,c,a,d,c,b,a
\tag{7}
\]
repeats vertices, and is not a matroid-independent tight path.

*Proof.* If a directed sequence has \(r\) turns, it reads a word \(x_1,\ldots,x_{r+3}\), each consecutive triple having distinct entries. The twisted terminal constraint reads
\((x_{r+1},x_{r+2},x_{r+3})=(x_3,x_2,x_1)\).
For \(r=2\) it yields the forbidden triple \((x_2,x_3,x_2)\); for \(r=3\) an adjacent equality \(x_4=x_3\); for \(r=4\) a forbidden triple \((x_3,x_4,x_3)\); and \(r=0,1\) are immediately impossible. Hence \(r\ge5\). The sequence (6) supplies the claimed example and its reversal-orbits are pairwise distinct. \(\square\)

**Theorem 6 (the tournament closing seam width three is optimal).** For pairwise distinct \(v_1,\ldots,v_m\), \(m\ge6\), the full tight triple sequence from \((v_1,v_2,v_3)\) to \((v_{m-2},v_{m-1},v_m)\) needs at least three directed transitions to reach the reversal \((v_3,v_2,v_1)\). The three-turn continuation
\[
(v_{m-1},v_m,v_3),\quad
(v_m,v_3,v_2),\quad
(v_3,v_2,v_1)
\tag{8}
\]
attains this minimum.

*Proof.* A one-step continuation would require \((v_{m-1},v_m)=(v_3,v_2)\), impossible by injectivity. A two-step continuation would require \(v_m=v_3\), also impossible. The continuation (8) respects consecutive ordered-pair overlaps and has the simple closing quotient proved in the earlier seam theorem. \(\square\)

**Proposition 7 (two ports are not enough).** In \(H_n^{\rm BT}\), \(n\ge4\), the four successive triple-state orbits represented by
\[
(1,0,2),\ (2,0,3),\ (1,0,3),\ (0,1,3)
\tag{9}
\]
form a simple cycle \(C\) with \((\alpha(C),\lambda(C))=(1,0)\), yet two of its turns are incoherent. Indeed, lift the four states and closing mate as
\[
(1,0,2),\ (3,0,2),\ (3,0,1),\ (0,1,3),\ (2,0,1).
\tag{10}
\]
The first two transitions are head--head and tail--tail respectively, while the other two are head--tail or tail--head. Hence curvature parity vanishes, although these are not all legal directed transitions. Thus the second port is an intrinsic useful refinement, but a valid long-path conjecture still must specify a *coherent directed witness family with an independent resource matroid*.

**Conjectural program.** Refine the pointed-gallery intersection conjecture to a *phase-prescribed two-port* theorem. Select odd-monodromy closed witnesses from the \((1,1)\) phase for full cube geodesics and from the \((1,0)\) phase for coherently directed tournament galleries, subject in both cases to independent resources. Theorem 6 explains why the boundary seam budget is three, rather than an artifact of one arbitrary closing construction. Theorem 5 and Proposition 7 demonstrate that a phase restriction alone still admits short resource-repeating or incoherent cycles. No universal four-intersection or two-intersection selector for the decorated two-port system is presently proved.

**Theorem 8 (seam triangle contraction changes curvature phase).** Let \(C\) be the length-\(m\) monodromy-one turn cycle obtained from a coherent directed twisted closure
\[
e_1\longrightarrow e_2\longrightarrow\cdots\longrightarrow e_m
\longrightarrow \rho e_1
\tag{11}
\]
in an oriented covering graph, with pairwise distinct quotient edge-state orbits, \(m\ge4\). Then the canonical lifted cyclic contact sequence of \(C\) has
\[
\boxed{s(C)=1,\qquad (\alpha(C),\lambda(C))=(1,0).}\tag{12}
\]
The unique stationary contact occurs at the first edge-state \(e_1\), because it is reached from the deck-translated predecessor and departed from through its head. Removing that edge-state by contracting its star triangle produces a simple cycle \(C'\) of \(H\) with
\[
\boxed{|C'|=m-1,\qquad
(\alpha(C'),\lambda(C'))=(1,1),\qquad
w_d(C')\le w_d(C)}
\tag{13}
\]
for every admissible deck-odd turn signature \(d\). The cost difference belongs to \(\{0,2\}\). This move therefore preserves cover monodromy and never increases coloring cost, but it **leaves the coherent-gallery phase**.

*Proof.* Each interior directed edge-state \(e_j\), \(j\ge2\), is contacted at its tail by the preceding directed edge and at its head by the succeeding one, so its contacts differ. The first edge-state \(e_1\) is contacted at its head by \(e_2\), while its other contact is the deck translate of the terminal meeting between \(e_m\) and \(\rho e_1\). Because \(\rho\) reverses the orientation, that translated contact is again the head of \(e_1\). Hence \(s(C)=1\). Theorem 2 gives \(\lambda(C)=1+s(C)=0\).

The edges of \(\widetilde F\) immediately preceding and following \(e_1\), after translating the preceding one to the same sheet, meet at the same vertex. Their three pairwise turns constitute a balanced star triangle. Replace the two consecutive turns through the vertex \([e_1]\) of \(C\) with the third side of that triangle. The resulting graph cycle \(C'\) is simple because the other quotient edge-state orbits were distinct and \(m\ge4\). It has the same monodromy, since the removed star triangle has monodromy zero. The contacts of all remaining lifted edge-states are unchanged, while the unique stationary contact of \(e_1\) is removed, giving \(s(C')=0\) and \(\lambda(C')=1\).

If the lifted edge-state colors in the star triangle are \(x,y,z\in\mathbb F_2\), its turn-cost change is
\[
(x\oplus y)+(y\oplus z)-(x\oplus z)
=2\,\mathbf1_{\{x=z\ne y\}}\in\{0,2\}.
\]
Thus \(w_d(C')\le w_d(C)\) simultaneously for every admissible coloring. \(\square\)

**Exchange warning.** Theorem 8 identifies a structural failure mode of undecorated cocircuit minimization. A cost-nonincreasing contraction of a marked tournament cocircuit may return a shorter cocircuit with the wrong orientation-curvature phase, even before resource independence is considered. A successful unifying exchange theorem must either preserve the prescribed \(\lambda\)-phase and coherent state language, or accompany the shortening by a controlled phase-repair splice. This is a stronger necessary design criterion than preserving only the original monodromy port.

**Theorem 9 (orientation curvature is monodromy plus a cover-independent line-graph class).** There is a canonical cohomology class \([\kappa_F]\in \mathbb F_2^{E(L(F))}/B^1(L(F))\), defined without reference to the covering \(\widetilde F\to F\), such that
\[
\boxed{[\lambda]=[a]+[\kappa_F].}\tag{14}
\]
To define \(\kappa_F\), orient the edges of the *base graph* \(F\) arbitrarily and, for each turn of \(H=L(F)\), set \(\kappa_F(t)=1\) if the two base edges meeting at its center have the same incidence sense, and zero otherwise. Its class is independent of those orientations. For every simple turn cycle \(C\),
\[
\boxed{\kappa_F(C)\equiv s(C)\pmod2.}\tag{15}
\]
Thus the additional binary datum is the universal *stationary-contact curvature of the line graph*, and the orientation-curvature phase of the cover equals this class twisted by monodromy. In the cube target, full geodesic cycles satisfy \((\alpha,\kappa_F)=(1,0)\). In the coherent boundary gallery target, closed directed galleries satisfy \((\alpha,\kappa_F)=(1,1)\). Short boundary star-triangle cycles satisfy \((\alpha,\kappa_F)=(1,0)\).

*Proof.* Reversing the orientation of an edge of \(F\) toggles \(\kappa_F\) on every turn incident with its vertex in \(L(F)\), hence adds a cut. For a lifted turn cycle \(C\), let its successive projected \(F\)-edges be \(f_1,\ldots,f_r,f_{r+1}=f_1\) with common center vertices \(w_i\), \(w_0=w_r\). Writing \(h(f,w)\) for the incidence head-bit of an oriented base edge, the turn label is
\[
\kappa_i=1+h(f_i,w_i)+h(f_{i+1},w_i).
\]
Summation yields
\[
\kappa_F(C)\equiv r+
\sum_{i=1}^r\bigl(h(f_i,w_{i-1})+h(f_i,w_i)\bigr)
\equiv r+(r-s(C))=s(C).
\]
Together with Theorem 2, this gives \(\lambda(C)=\alpha(C)+\kappa_F(C)\) for every cycle \(C\), hence (14) because a cochain annihilating the graph cycle space is a cut. The three model-specific pairs follow from their stationary-contact counts already proved. \(\square\)

**Structural significance.** Equation (14) removes any dependence on an arbitrary orientation upstairs: the two cohomological degrees of freedom are the covering class \([a]\) and an intrinsic characteristic class \([\kappa_F]\) of the base line graph. The common pointed-matroid generalization can therefore be phrased as a graph-cover lift *with its canonical line-graph contact curvature*. This is a cleaner mathematical hypothesis than adding unrelated direction or seam labels, although the counterexamples in Theorems 5 and 7 show that resource independence and coherent orientation remain necessary for long-path decoding.

**Corollary 10 (bipointed cographic deletion and asymmetric witness ports).** Let \(D^{(2)}=(\widehat M^{(2)})^*\) be the dual of the two-port matroid (4). Then
\[
\boxed{D^{(2)}\setminus\{p,q\}\cong M(H)^*,}\tag{16}
\]
a cographic matroid. For each admissible deck-odd turn signature \(d=a+\delta f\), the set
\[
\boxed{X_d=\operatorname{supp}(d)\cup\{p\}}\tag{17}
\]
is a binary cycle of \(D^{(2)}\) that contains \(p\) but not \(q\). For a simple turn cycle \(C\), the associated dual cocircuit is
\[
Y_C=C\cup p^{\alpha(C)}\cup q^{\lambda(C)},\tag{18}
\]
where exponent one means the corresponding port is included. When \(\alpha(C)=1\),
\[
\boxed{|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+w_d(C).}\tag{19}
\]
Therefore full cube-geodesic witnesses are cocircuits containing **both** \(p,q\), while coherent boundary-tournament closure witnesses are cocircuits containing \(p\) and **excluding** \(q\). This port-membership distinction replaces the external terminology of curvature phases with an intrinsic matroid condition.

*Proof.* Contracting both independent unit columns \(p,q\) in the matrix (4) removes the two bottom rows and leaves the graphic incidence representation \(B_H\). Dualizing turns contraction into deletion, proving (16). The rows of (4) generate cycles of \(D^{(2)}\); combining the \(a\)-row with incidence rows produces \((d,1,0)\), proving (17). Formula (18) is Theorem 3 interpreted as a dual cocircuit. Formula (19) follows by counting the common port \(p\) and the support of \(d\) on \(C\). The geometric port memberships were established in Corollary 4. \(\square\)

**Refined unified conjectural form.** Seek a statement for bipointed binary matroids with cographic double deletion, a distinguished coherent resource-independent gallery family, and locally generated balanced relations: every admissible \(p\)-containing, \(q\)-avoiding binary cycle should meet a resource-large marked cocircuit in a bounded even number of elements, with the cocircuit's \(q\)-membership prescribed by the gallery type. The cube asks for *both-port* witnesses of full coordinate rank, whereas the boundary model asks for *\(p\)-only* witnesses of resource rank \(\Omega(\sqrt n)\). The two-port matroid identifies the appropriate cocircuit sectors but does not itself guarantee large resources or small intersection.

Let \(n\ge5\). Write \(S_n\) for the ordered-pair double cover of \(L(K_n)\), with vertices \((u,v)\) and undirected edges labelled by triples \(t=(a,b,c)\), corresponding to \((a,b)-(b,c)\), where the three symbols are distinct. Its deck involution reverses ordered pairs and triple labels. Put
\[
H_{\rm full}=L(S_n)/\langle\rho\rangle\cong L^2(K_n).
\]
The covering \(L(S_n)\to H_{\rm full}\) defines the pointed binary dual \(D_{\rm full}\) of the incidence-plus-monodromy matrix of Article XI.

Declare a turn between triple states **legal** if it has a lift of the form
\[
(a,b,c)\;--\;(b,c,d),\qquad
a,b,c,d\text{ pairwise distinct},
\tag{1}
\]
or the reverse traversal. Let \(F\subseteq E(H_{\rm full})\) be its set of legal turns and \(H_{\rm leg}=(V(H_{\rm full}),F)\). This is the quotient of the alternating-port ordered-triple overlap graph from Article XI. Let \(T=E(H_{\rm full})\setminus F\).

**Theorem 1 (three-turn reconstruction).** Every omitted turn \(e\in T\) has a lifted representative joining two triple states \(t,t'\) that can be joined by a legal-turn path of length at most three in the ordered-triple graph. The projected path \(P_e\subseteq F\) can be chosen such that \(P_e\cup\{e\}\) is a simple cycle of \(H_{\rm full}\) with trivial covering monodromy. In particular,
\[
\boxed{\forall X\in Z(D_{\rm full}),\quad
\mathbf1_X(e)=\sum_{f\in P_e}\mathbf1_X(f)\pmod2,\qquad |P_e|\le3.}
\tag{2}
\]
Equivalently, every \(e\in T\) belongs to a cocircuit \(Y_e\) of \(D_{\rm full}\) avoiding the port and satisfying
\[
\boxed{Y_e\cap T=\{e\},\qquad |Y_e|\le4.}\tag{3}
\]
The bound three in (2) is attained by the forbidden return turns.

*Proof.* Fix the ordered-pair state \((u,v)\) at which the lifted omitted turn meets. Its incident triple states are of two types,
\[
I_w=(w,u,v),\qquad O_z=(u,v,z),
\quad w,z\notin\{u,v\}.
\]
The legal turns at this state are \(I_w--O_z\) with \(w\ne z\). Every omitted turn falls into one of the following cases.

If \(e=I_wI_{w'}\), with \(w\ne w'\), choose \(z\notin\{u,v,w,w'\}\). Then
\(I_w--O_z--I_{w'}\) is a legal two-turn path.

If \(e=O_zO_{z'}\), choose \(w\notin\{u,v,z,z'\}\). Then
\(O_z--I_w--O_{z'}\) is a legal two-turn path.

If \(e=I_wO_w\), choose distinct \(x,y\notin\{u,v,w\}\). Then
\[
I_w--O_x--I_y--O_w
\tag{4}
\]
is a legal three-turn path. These choices exist for \(n\ge5\). In each case the displayed triple states belong to different reversal orbits, so their projections together with \(e\) form a simple cycle. The lifted path followed by the reversed omitted turn closes on the original sheet, hence that cycle has monodromy zero. Its edge set is therefore a non-port circuit of the incidence-plus-monodromy matroid, equivalently a non-port cocircuit of \(D_{\rm full}\). Binary cycle–cocircuit orthogonality yields (2) and (3). \(\square\)
