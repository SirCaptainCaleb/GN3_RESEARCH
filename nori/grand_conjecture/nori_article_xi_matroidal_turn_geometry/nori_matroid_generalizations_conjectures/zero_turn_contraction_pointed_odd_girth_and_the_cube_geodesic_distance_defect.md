# Zero-turn contraction, pointed odd girth, and the cube geodesic distance defect

# Zero-turn contraction, pointed odd girth, and the cube geodesic distance defect

Let \(\widetilde G\to G\) be a connected regular two-sheeted graph cover, with induced connected turn cover over \(H=L(G)\). Let \(a\in C^1(H;\mathbb F_2)\) represent the covering-monodromy class. The pointed lift dual from Article XI is
\[
D=M\begin{pmatrix}B_H&0\\ a&1\end{pmatrix}^{*},
\tag{1}
\]
with distinguished port \(p\). Any deck-odd coloring gives \(d=a+\delta f\); its associated port-containing binary cycle is \(X_d=\operatorname{supp}(d)\cup\{p\}\).

The dependence on the coloring can be consolidated into a smaller **signed contraction graph**. This gives a full characterization of *unrestricted* port-cocircuit intersection and, in the cube, a metric distance defect whose vanishing is equivalent to NORI1.

## 1. Zero-turn contraction and pointed odd girth

Define \(H_0(d)=(V(H),\{e:d(e)=0\})\), with all original vertices and only zero-turn edges. Contract each connected component of \(H_0(d)\) to one vertex; retain all edges \(e\) with \(d(e)=1\), including parallel edges and loops. Denote the resulting multigraph by \(K_d\). A loop has odd-girth contribution one. Let \(\operatorname{og}(K_d)\) denote the minimum edge count of an odd cycle, with \(+\infty\) if none exists.

**Theorem 1 (zero-turn odd-girth normal form).** For any deck-odd coloring and its pointed cycle \(X_d\),
\[
\boxed{
\min_{\substack{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D)\\p\in Y}}
|X_d\cap Y|
=1+\operatorname{og}(K_d).
}
\tag{2}
\]
The contracted graph \(K_d\) is nonbipartite (where loops count as odd cycles), so its odd girth is finite. More precisely, the contraction of the *primal* pointed matroid (1) by all zero-turn elements is represented, after elementary row operations, by
\[
\boxed{
\widehat M/H_0(d)\cong
M\begin{pmatrix}B_{K_d}&0\\ \mathbf1&1\end{pmatrix},
}
\tag{3}
\]
where \(\widehat M=D^*\), \(B_{K_d}\) is the incidence matrix of the contracted multigraph, and \(\mathbf1\) assigns one to each retained graph edge. The dual statement is deletion of the zero-turn elements from \(D\).

*Proof.* Replace the bottom row \(a\) in (1) by \(d=a+\delta f\) using vertex-incidence row operations. The columns corresponding to \(d=0\) then have bottom entry zero; contracting them identifies precisely the vertices in each connected component of \(H_0(d)\). The remaining columns represent \(B_{K_d}\) with bottom entry one, and the port still has bottom entry one, proving (3).

By the pointed covering representation, a port-containing cocircuit of \(D\) has the form \(Y_C=C\cup\{p\}\) for a simple cycle \(C\subseteq H\) with monodromy one, and
\[
|X_d\cap Y_C|=1+w_d(C),\qquad
w_d(C)=\sum_{e\in C}d(e),
\tag{4}
\]
where \(w_d\) is an integer. Since \(d\) represents monodromy, \(w_d(C)\) is odd.

Under the component contraction, \(C\) becomes a closed walk in \(K_d\) having \(w_d(C)\) edges: all zero turns have been contracted. Every odd closed walk contains an odd simple cycle, possibly a loop. Consequently
\(\operatorname{og}(K_d)\le w_d(C)\).

Conversely, take a shortest odd cycle of \(K_d\), of length \(g=\operatorname{og}(K_d)\). For each pair of its consecutive retained edges meeting at a contracted vertex, join their original endpoints by a path of zero turns inside the corresponding component of \(H_0(d)\). These zero paths and the \(g\) retained edges assemble a closed walk of \(H\) with odd monodromy and total integer turn weight \(g\). Split this closed walk into simple cycles, discarding paired traversals. Its mod-two turn sum is one, so at least one simple component has odd monodromy and weight at most \(g\). This gives a port cocircuit intersecting \(X_d\) in at most \(1+g\), proving (2).

Finally, if \(K_d\) were bipartite, its constant-one edge cochain would be a cut. Pulling that cut back through the zero-turn components would make \(d\) a cut of \(H\), contradicting the nonzero covering-monodromy class \(a\). Thus \(K_d\) has an odd cycle. \(\square\)

**Corollary 2 (single-disagreement loops).** A port cocircuit \(Y\) with \(|X_d\cap Y|=2\) exists if and only if \(K_d\) has a loop; equivalently, some positive-turn edge \(e=uv\) has both endpoints in the **same** connected component of \(H_0(d)\).

For the folded cube, the established nongeodesic monochromatic-antipodal-path theorem supplies this loop for every antipodally odd coloring. The open geodesic conjecture asks for a loop with a much stronger distance property.

## 2. The cube zero-turn metric

Let \(n\ge4\), \(G_n=Q_n/\langle\tau\rangle\), \(H_n=L(G_n)\), and \(d\) be any deck-odd cube-edge coloring signature. Let
\[
\mathcal L_d=
\{\,e=uv\in E(H_n): d(e)=1,\ 
u,v\text{ lie in one component of }H_0(d)\,\}.
\tag{5}
\]
These are precisely the positive-turn edges that become loops of \(K_d\). For \(e=uv\in\mathcal L_d\), let \(\operatorname{dist}_{H_0(d)}(u,v)\) be their ordinary shortest-path distance using only zero-turn edges, and put
\[
\boxed{\ell_1(d)=
1+\min_{uv\in\mathcal L_d}
\operatorname{dist}_{H_0(d)}(u,v),}
\tag{6}
\]
taking \(+\infty\) when \(\mathcal L_d\) is empty.

**Theorem 3 (quantized geodesic distance defect).** When \(\mathcal L_d\ne\varnothing\), there exists an integer \(q_d\ge0\) such that
\[
\boxed{\ell_1(d)=n+2q_d.}
\tag{7}
\]
Moreover,
\[
\boxed{
\text{A full monochromatic antipodal geodesic exists}
\iff \ell_1(d)=n
\iff \min_{uv\in\mathcal L_d}\operatorname{dist}_{H_0(d)}(u,v)=n-1.
}
\tag{8}
\]
In particular, a hypothetical coloring refuting NORI1 must satisfy
\[
\boxed{
\operatorname{dist}_{H_0(d)}(u,v)\ge n+1
\quad\text{for EVERY }uv\in\mathcal L_d.
}
\tag{9}
\]

*Proof.* Every \(e=uv\in\mathcal L_d\), together with a shortest zero-turn path from \(u\) to \(v\), forms a simple turn cycle \(C_e\) with \(w_d(C_e)=1\). Thus \(\ell_1(d)\) is the minimum length of a simple odd-monodromy turn cycle containing precisely one positive-turn edge. Every odd-monodromy simple turn cycle in \(H_n\) has length at least \(n\), by the antipodal displacement bound of Article XI.

Choose such a cycle of minimum length, \(C\). If it contains a stationary edge state, the star-triangle shortening theorem permits deleting that state while retaining simplicity and odd monodromy. Its two incident turn labels are binary, and the shortcut label is their XOR. Since \(C\) contains only one positive-turn label, the integer turn cost of the shortened cycle is still one (it cannot be zero, by odd monodromy). This contradicts the minimum choice. Consequently \(C\) has no stationary contacts.

Its lifted edge-state sequence therefore represents a moving cube walk from \(x\) to \(x^*\), of length \(|C|=\ell_1(d)\). Each of the \(n\) coordinate directions appears an **odd positive** number of times in such a walk. Hence the length is \(n+2q_d\) for a nonnegative integer \(q_d\), proving (7).

If \(\ell_1(d)=n\), the lifted walk uses each coordinate once, so it is a full antipodal geodesic. Its cyclic turn word has one nonzero label; choose the root immediately after that turn, making all \(n-1\) internal turns zero. Conversely, a monochromatic full antipodal geodesic has precisely one cyclic nonzero turn (its closing seam, by reversal oddness); its turn cycle has length \(n\), showing \(\ell_1(d)\le n\). The antipodal lower bound forces equality. Formula (6) gives the remaining equivalence, and (7) gives (9) under the negation. \(\square\)

**Corollary 4 (explicit graph algorithm).** For a supplied cube coloring, the existence of a full monochromatic antipodal geodesic can be decided without enumerating \(n!\) coordinate permutations. Form \(H_0(d)\), find its connected components, and for every positive-turn edge \(uv\) internal to a zero component run a shortest-path search from \(u\) to \(v\) in \(H_0(d)\). A shortest path with \(n-1\) edges together with \(uv\) certifies a monochromatic antipodal geodesic. A direct implementation takes
\[
O\bigl(|E(H_n)|(|V(H_n)|+|E(H_n)|)\bigr)
\]
time and linear working space in the explicit turn graph. The method does not decide the all-dimensional conjecture uniformly; it decides the instance given by its complete edge coloring.

## 3. What the contraction preserves and what it loses

Theorem 1 settles the **unrestricted minimum port-cocircuit intersection** as an odd-girth calculation after zero-turn contraction. But contraction discards both the number of zero turns used between positive turns and the moving-coordinate resources of the lift. A loop of \(K_d\) is therefore not necessarily a geodesic cocircuit: its shortest zero path can contain repeated moving directions, forcing a cycle of length \(n+2q_d\) with \(q_d>0\).

The distinction is now measured by the intrinsic nonnegative integer \(q_d\). Existing unrestricted port-two intersection results guarantee that \(q_d\) is finite for the cube. NORI1 is equivalent to \(q_d=0\). Any general matroid theorem proving that a point-loop of the zero-turn contraction can be **shortened to the covering-displacement distance** under the folded-cube exchange axioms would establish NORI1. The star-triangle shortening theorem removes stationary contacts but preserves moving-direction multiplicities; balanced hexagon exchanges alter the coordinate order but need not reduce the repeated-direction excess. Thus the remaining obstruction is a metric/resource defect, not a deficit of pointed-matroid parity.

## 4. Intrinsic binary-matroid port-parallelism formulation

The graph contraction above is a special case of a matroid identity that does not assume a graph-cover representation.

**Lemma 5 (port-cocircuit intersection as a dual-minor circuit girth).** Let \(D\) be a finite matroid, \(p\in E(D)\), and \(X\subseteq E(D)\) with \(p\in X\). Put \(S=E(D)\setminus X\) and \(N=D^*/S\). Then
\[
\boxed{
\min_{\substack{Y\in\mathcal C^*(D)\\p\in Y}}
|X\cap Y|
=\min_{\substack{C\in\mathcal C(N)\\p\in C}}|C|.
}
\tag{10}
\]
Either minimum may be infinite if there is no relevant circuit or cocircuit.

*Proof.* Every circuit \(C\) of the contraction \(D^*/S\) lifts to a circuit \(Y\) of \(D^*\) with \(Y\setminus S=C\); this is the circuit description of matroid contraction. Hence the left-hand minimum is at most the right-hand minimum. Conversely, if \(Y\) is a circuit of \(D^*\) containing \(p\), then \(p\) lies in the closure of \(Y\setminus\{p\}\). After contracting \(S\), it still lies in the closure of \((Y\cap X)\setminus\{p\}\) in \(N\). Therefore a circuit \(C\) of \(N\) containing \(p\) exists inside \(Y\cap X\), and \(|C|\le|Y\cap X|\). This proves the reverse inequality. \(\square\)

**Corollary 6 (unrestricted two-intersection is parallelism).** If \(D\) is binary and \(X\in Z(D)\) contains \(p\), then \(p\) is **not a loop** of the contracted dual minor \(N=D^*/(E(D)\setminus X)\). Moreover
\[
\boxed{
\exists Y\in\mathcal C^*(D)\ (p\in Y,\ |X\cap Y|=2)
\iff
p\text{ belongs to a two-element parallel circuit of }N.
}
\tag{11}
\]
In the signed-cover representation, the parallel element is a positive-turn loop of \(K_d\): both its column and the port column of the contracted primal matrix (3) are \((0,\ldots,0,1)^\mathsf T\).

*Proof.* Binary cycle–cocircuit orthogonality forbids any one-element intersection of \(X\) with a cocircuit containing \(p\). Lemma 5 thus forbids a port loop in \(N\) and identifies intersection two with a two-element port circuit of \(N\). In (3), a positive graph loop has zero incidence column and bottom entry one, as does the port, proving the claimed correspondence. \(\square\)

This provides a fully matroid-intrinsic unrestricted two-intersection criterion, independent of shortest-cocircuit size. The remaining cube conjecture additionally asks that a corresponding lifted port cocircuit have size \(n+1\). The contraction minor forgets the lengths of its contracted zero-turn paths; Theorem 3 measures precisely that lost resource-length information by \(q_d\).

## 5. Graphic-matroid fundamental circuits and a basis-selection form of NORI1

The distance defect of Theorem 3 can also be expressed using **basis exchange inside a graphic matroid**, without referencing a selected path. Let \(M_0=M(H_0(d))\), the cycle matroid of the zero-turn graph, and let \(\mathcal B_0\) be its set of spanning-forest bases. For \(T\in\mathcal B_0\) and a positive edge \(e=uv\in\mathcal L_d\), let \(C_T(e)\) be the unique fundamental circuit of \(e\) relative to \(T\) in the full graphic cycle matroid \(M(H_n)\). Equivalently, \(C_T(e)\) is \(e\) together with the unique tree path connecting its ends.

**Proposition 7 (basis-choice formula for the defect).** For any antipodally odd cube-edge coloring with \(\mathcal L_d\ne\varnothing\),
\[
\boxed{
\ell_1(d)=\min_{\substack{T\in\mathcal B_0\\e\in\mathcal L_d}}
|C_T(e)|,\qquad
q_d=\frac12\left(
\min_{\substack{T\in\mathcal B_0\\e\in\mathcal L_d}}|C_T(e)|-n
\right).
}
\tag{12}
\]
Consequently,
\[
\boxed{\text{NORI1 for this coloring}\iff
\exists\,T\in\mathcal B_0,\ e\in\mathcal L_d:\ |C_T(e)|=n.}
\tag{13}
\]

*Proof.* Every \(T\in\mathcal B_0\) joins the endpoints of every \(e\in\mathcal L_d\) by a zero-turn tree path, so \(|C_T(e)|-1\ge\operatorname{dist}_{H_0(d)}(u,v)\). Conversely, a shortest zero-turn path \(P\) from \(u\) to \(v\) is an independent set of the graphic matroid \(M_0\) and can be extended to a spanning-forest basis \(T\). Because \(T\) contains \(P\), its unique tree path between \(u,v\) is \(P\); thus \(|C_T(e)|=1+|P|\). Minimize over \(e\) and invoke Theorem 3. \(\square\)

This separates the proposed general matroid argument into two logically distinct steps. The unrestricted port intersection theorem supplies **parallelism after contracting all zero turns**, i.e. a positive \(e\) closing inside a zero component. The missing step is a compatible **basis selection** of that zero-turn component in which the mate \(e\) has a fundamental circuit of the covering-displacement length \(n\).

The latter property is stronger than ordinary matroid exchange or binary orthogonality: it compares a fundamental-circuit cardinality with the geometric displacement of the two-cover. Once that cardinality is \(n\), the cube's antipodal parity automatically forces each coordinate resource to occur once, so no further resource-independence hypothesis is needed in the cube model. For boundary tournaments, by contrast, a short port circuit need not use many original vertices, and the independent-resource path language must still be supplied separately.

## 6. Chordless minimizers and simple moving cycles

The minimum-length one-disagreement cycle has a stronger structural property than the absence of stationary contacts.

**Theorem 8 (one-disagreement chord elimination).** Let \(H\) be a finite simple graph with a binary edge cochain \(d\). Among all simple cycles with integer turn weight
\[
w_d(C)=\sum_{e\in C}d(e)=1,
\]
choose a cycle \(C\) of minimum length. Then \(C\) is an **induced cycle of \(H\)**: there is no edge of \(H\) joining nonconsecutive vertices of \(C\). More generally, every one-disagreement simple cycle admits a sequence of strictly length-decreasing chord eliminations ending at an induced one-disagreement cycle.

*Proof.* Let \(h\) be a chord of a simple cycle \(C\) with \(w_d(C)=1\). The chord splits \(C\) into two strictly shorter simple cycles, using its two complementary arcs. Of the arcs, precisely one contains the unique positive-turn edge of \(C\). If \(d(h)=0\), choose the arc containing that edge; the resulting shorter cycle still has weight one. If \(d(h)=1\), choose the other arc, whose original edges all have cost zero; the chord contributes its unique positive edge. In both cases there is a shorter one-disagreement cycle. Iteration terminates and establishes the result. \(\square\)

**Corollary 9 (simple folded-cube core).** For the cube \(n\ge4\), a minimum-length monodromy-one cycle with one changed turn projects from \(H_n=L(G_n)\) to a **simple odd-monodromy cycle in \(G_n=Q_n/\tau\)**, whose lift is a self-avoiding path between antipodal vertices of \(Q_n\), with no two interior vertices related by the antipodal map. Its length is \(n+2q_d\).

*Proof.* Theorem 8 makes the turn cycle an induced cycle of \(L(G_n)\), of length at least \(n\ge4\). Any induced line-graph cycle of length at least four arises from a simple cycle of the base graph: consecutive edge-state vertices must meet at different endpoints of each base edge, else the preceding and following states are adjacent and create a chord. Moreover the contact vertices cannot repeat, since three or more selected edge states would then lie in the same base-vertex star clique, producing a chord of the induced cycle. Thus the moving walk is a simple base-graph cycle. Its monodromy is one, so its lifted path begins and ends at antipodal vertices, and no two distinct interior vertices project to the same base vertex. The direction-parity argument of Theorem 3 gives its length \(n+2q_d\). \(\square\)

**Example (why chordlessness alone does not close NORI1).** In every dimension \(n\ge4\), the following cube-vertex sequence, written as subsets of \([n]\), is a path from \(\varnothing\) to \([n]\):
\[
\varnothing,\ \{1\},\ \{1,2\},\ \{2\},\ \{2,3\},\
\{1,2,3\},\ \{1,2,3,4\},\ldots,[n].
\tag{14}
\]
Its direction sequence is \(1,2,1,3,1,4,5,\ldots,n\), of length \(n+2\). Its intermediate vertices have pairwise distinct antipodal orbits, so its projection is a simple monodromy-one cycle of length \(n+2\) in \(G_n\), corresponding to an induced turn cycle in \(H_n\). This is a geometric example, not an alleged NORI1 counterexample: prescribing one changed turn on this longer cycle does not rule out a monochromatic geodesic elsewhere.

Thus Theorem 8 removes all chord and stationary-contact defects from the shortest one-positive cocircuit, leaving **simple odd-voltage cycles of excess \(2q_d\)** as the sole geometric obstruction. A successful closure argument must exploit the cube's coordinate-square exchange structure to eliminate that positive excess; graph-theoretic chord shortening by itself is insufficient.

## 7. Antipodal component-contact graph and port-parallel bundles

Let \(\widetilde G\to G\) be a connected regular two-sheeted graph cover with deck transformation \(\tau\), and let \(c:E(\widetilde G)\to\mathbb F_2\) be deck-odd, so \(c(\tau e)=1+c(e)\). Let \(R\) be the subgraph of color-zero covering edges, omitting isolated vertices; write \(R_1,\ldots,R_s\) for its edge-containing connected components. For a lifted vertex \(x\) incident with a red edge define \(\rho(x)=i\) by \(x\in R_i\), and put \(a_x=\deg_R(x)\), including \(a_x=0\) when no red edge is incident.

Construct the **antipodal component-contact multigraph** \(A_c\) with vertices \(R_1,\ldots,R_s\). For each pair \(\{x,\tau x\}\) with \(a_xa_{\tau x}>0\), place \(a_xa_{\tau x}\) parallel edges between \(R_{\rho(x)}\) and \(R_{\rho(\tau x)}\), allowing loops.

**Theorem 10 (component-contact realization).** Let \(K_d\) be the zero-turn contraction of the quotient line graph \(H=L(G)\) from Theorem 1. There is a canonical multigraph isomorphism
\[
\boxed{K_d\cong A_c.}\tag{15}
\]
In particular \(K_d\) is connected and nonbipartite. The entire contribution of a lifted vertex orbit is a single parallel edge bundle of cardinality
\[
\boxed{a_xa_{\tau x}=a_x(\deg_{\widetilde G}(x)-a_x).}\tag{16}
\]

*Proof.* Lift the zero-turn graph to \(L(\widetilde G)\). Its edges join incident covering edges of the same color, so its connected components are the line graphs of the monochromatic edge components. The deck transformation exchanges colors and pairs \(R_i\) with the color-one component \(\tau R_i\); the quotient zero-turn components are therefore indexed by red components \(R_i\). A positive turn at \(x\) joins a red covering edge at \(x\) to a blue covering edge at \(x\). The latter is the deck image of a red covering edge at \(\tau x\). Its two quotient components are \(R_{\rho(x)}\) and \(R_{\rho(\tau x)}\). Every choice of one red edge at each antipodal endpoint specifies one positive-turn orbit, and no orbit is counted twice since \(x,\tau x\) are one base vertex. This gives \(a_xa_{\tau x}\) parallel edges and exhausts the positive turns. Theorem 1 gives connectedness and nonbipartiteness. Deck oddness implies \(a_{\tau x}=\deg_{\widetilde G}(x)-a_x\). \(\square\)

**Corollary 11 (large parallel bundles).** If the covering graph has minimum degree \(m\ge3\), every edge of \(K_d\) belongs to a parallel bundle containing at least \(m-1\) elements. Every nonloop edge lies in a two-edge cycle; hence \(K_d\) has no bridges.

*Proof.* Both factors in a nonempty bundle are positive integers summing to a degree at least \(m\), so their product is at least \(m-1\). Each bundle consists of edges with the same two endpoints. \(\square\)

**Corollary 12 (loop characterization and port-parallel amplification).** The graph \(K_d\) has a loop if and only if some color-zero edge component \(R_i\) contains an antipodal pair \(x,\tau x\). More precisely, an edge contributed by the vertex orbit \(\{x,\tau x\}\) is a loop if and only if \(\rho(x)=\rho(\tau x)\). Such a vertex orbit contributes at least \(m-1\) distinct loops when the minimum degree is \(m\ge3\). In the primal pointed contraction of Theorem 1, these loop columns are all identical to the port column, so the port has at least \(m-1\) parallel mates.

*Proof.* The edge corresponding to \(\{x,\tau x\}\) is a loop if and only if \(\rho(x)=\rho(\tau x)\). In the contracted incidence-plus-monodromy matrix, a graph loop has zero incidence column and bottom entry one, as does the distinguished port. Apply Corollary 11. \(\square\)

**Lemma 13 (monochromatic antipodal metric).** In the cube cover,
\[
\boxed{
\ell_1(d)=
\min_{\substack{x\in Q_n,\ \varepsilon\in\{0,1\}\\
x,\tau x\text{ joined by an }\varepsilon\text{-colored path}}}
\operatorname{dist}_{G_\varepsilon}(x,\tau x),
}\tag{17}
\]
where \(G_\varepsilon\) is the spanning subgraph of cube edges of color \(\varepsilon\), and the distance is measured inside that monochromatic subgraph.

*Proof.* Any monochromatic antipodal path gives a turn walk of zero internal cost and one positive closing turn, hence an odd-monodromy turn walk of no larger length. Splitting it into simple cycles yields a one-positive simple cycle and proves \(\ell_1(d)\) is no larger than the monochromatic distance. Conversely, Theorem 3 shortens a minimum one-positive turn cycle to a moving stationary-free cycle, which lifts to a monochromatic cube path between antipodal vertices of length \(\ell_1(d)\). \(\square\)

**Proposition 14 (uniform near-short circuits within one loop bundle).** Suppose \(x,\tau x\) belong to the same color-zero component \(R_i\), and put \(L_x=\operatorname{dist}_{R_i}(x,\tau x)\). Every one of the \(a_xa_{\tau x}\) loop elements from the orbit \(\{x,\tau x\}\) belongs to a port cocircuit \(Y\) such that
\[
\boxed{|Y|\le L_x+3,\qquad |X_d\cap Y|=2.}\tag{18}
\]
These cocircuits are distinct for distinct loop edges. Consequently, for a cube coloring whose minimum monochromatic antipodal distance is \(\ell_1(d)=n+2q_d\), at least \(n-1\) distinct port cocircuits have intersection two and size at most \(n+2q_d+3\).

*Proof.* Let \(P\) be a shortest red \(x\)-to-\(\tau x\) path of length \(L_x\). Its edge states form a zero-turn path of length \(L_x-1\). Replace its initial edge by any other red edge incident at \(x\), and its terminal edge by any other red edge incident at \(\tau x\); these replacements add at most one zero turn each. Thus every pair of red incident edges at \(x,\tau x\) is joined by a zero-turn walk of length at most \(L_x+1\) in the quotient state graph. Close it by its associated positive-turn element (one of the loop bundle), and shorten the zero walk to a simple zero path. The result is a simple odd-monodromy cycle of length at most \(L_x+2\) with one positive turn. Adding the port gives (18); its positive-turn element identifies it uniquely. Take an antipodal pair attaining Lemma 13 and apply the cube degree \(m=n\) to obtain the multiplicity assertion. \(\square\)

The contact-graph structure is significantly more restrictive than an arbitrary nonbipartite multigraph: each edge belongs to a large parallel bundle, and a self-contact component yields many port-parallel elements with uniformly bounded circuit-length spread. Nevertheless, a loop is a certificate of monochromatic antipodal **connectivity**, not necessarily of a geodesic. The unresolved geometric condition is \(L_x=n\) for some self-contact, which would force zero directional excess and close NORI1.

## 8. Eulerian conservation in the antipodal contact minor

Regularity of the covering graph imposes a second global constraint on \(K_d\), beyond the large parallel bundles in Corollary 11.

**Theorem 15 (Eulerian contact conservation).** Suppose \(\widetilde G\to G\) is a connected regular two-cover, \(\widetilde G\) is \(m\)-regular, and \(c(\tau e)=1-c(e)\). Then the contracted antipodal component-contact multigraph \(K_d\) of Theorem 10 is **Eulerian**:
\[
\boxed{\deg_{K_d}(R_i)\equiv0\pmod2\qquad
\text{for every color-zero edge component }R_i.}
\tag{19}
\]
More precisely,
\[
\boxed{
\deg_{K_d}(R_i)
=\sum_{x\in V(R_i)}a_x(m-a_x),\qquad
a_x=\deg_{R_i}(x).
}
\tag{20}
\]
Loops contribute two to the graph degree.

If \(m\) is odd, every *individual local parallel bundle* has even cardinality. If \(m\) is even, a local bundle has odd cardinality precisely when \(a_x\) is odd; the collection of odd-cardinality bundles, considered modulo two on the contact graph, forms an Eulerian subgraph.

*Proof.* A base vertex orbit \(\{x,\tau x\}\) contributes \(a_xa_{\tau x}\) edges between the red components containing \(x\) and \(\tau x\), by Theorem 10. Its contribution to the degree of a red component is \(a_xa_{\tau x}\) for each endpoint \(x\) of that orbit lying in the component; if both antipodal endpoints belong to it, the bundle is a loop and the contribution is counted twice. Summing the contributions over all vertices of \(R_i\) gives (20), since deck oddness and \(m\)-regularity yield \(a_{\tau x}=m-a_x\).

Working modulo two, \(a_x(m-a_x)\equiv(m-1)a_x\), because \(a_x^2\equiv a_x\pmod2\). The degree-sum identity inside \(R_i\) gives \(\sum_{x\in V(R_i)}a_x=2|E(R_i)|\equiv0\pmod2\). Therefore (20) is even, proving (19). For odd \(m\), the positive integers \(a_x\) and \(m-a_x\) have opposite parity and their product is even. For even \(m\), the product has the parity of \(a_x\); the already-proved even-degree condition says the odd-bundle edge set has even degree at every contact-graph vertex. \(\square\)

**Corollary 16 (common Eulerian-port-minor axiom).** The cube cover \(Q_n\to Q_n/\tau\) is \(n\)-regular. The ordered-pair cover used for ordinary boundary 3-tournaments, \(S(K_n)\to L(K_n)\), is \(2(n-2)\)-regular. Thus **both** canonical Article XI signed turn models yield Eulerian zero-turn contractions for every reversal-odd coloring. The cube additionally has even local parallel multiplicities in odd dimensions; the boundary model always lies in the even-degree branch.

In matroid language, the entire positive-turn edge multiset of \(K_d\) is a cycle of its graphic matroid \(M(K_d)\). The parity reduction of local parallel bundles is itself an Eulerian cycle. Consequently a proposed abstract common class may require an Eulerian contact minor, quantitative parallel bundles, and a distinguished port-parallel loop whose lifted fundamental circuit has covering-displacement length. The first two properties are theorems for all regular two-covers; the last is the unresolved NORI1 selector.

**Limitation.** A connected nonbipartite Eulerian multigraph with all nonloop edges in large parallel classes need not have any loops: an odd cycle with each edge replaced by two parallel edges is a counterexample to that implication. Therefore regularity and Eulerian parity alone cannot replace the cube-specific antipodal connectivity theorem, much less guarantee a length-\(n\) loop lift. These restrictions nevertheless exclude most arbitrary pointed binary matroids and supply a useful common structural hypothesis for future matroid generalizations.

## 9. Global contact-edge parity as a covering-cohomology evaluation

The Eulerian conservation law has a global counterpart. Let \(\beta\in H^1(G;\mathbb F_2)\) denote the monodromy class of a connected regular two-cover \(\widetilde G\to G\), where \(G\) is \(m\)-regular. The number of nonzero-turn edges is
\[
|E(K_d)|=\sum_{v\in V(G)}a_v(m-a_v),
\tag{21}
\]
with \(a_v\) the number of red covering edges incident with either selected lift of \(v\).

**Theorem 17 (covering-cohomology edge-parity identity).** If \(m\) is odd, then \(|E(K_d)|\) is even for every deck-odd coloring. If \(m\) is even, the all-edge set \(E(G)\) is a binary cycle of \(G\), and
\[
\boxed{
|E(K_d)|\equiv
\left\langle\beta,\ E(G)\right\rangle
\pmod2.
}
\tag{22}
\]
Thus for an even-regular quotient, the parity of the total changed-turn set depends only on the covering, **not** on the deck-odd coloring.

*Proof.* Fix one reference lift \(s(v)\) of every base vertex, and represent the covering by a binary edge-voltage cochain \(\alpha\): it is one on a base edge \(uv\) precisely when its lift from \(s(u)\) meets \(\tau s(v)\). Let \(a_v\) count red edges incident with \(s(v)\). Modulo two, \(a_v(m-a_v)\equiv(m-1)a_v\).

For each base edge \(uv\), the deck-odd coloring chooses one of its two covering-edge lifts to be red. If \(\alpha(uv)=0\), this chosen red lift is incident with either both reference endpoints \(s(u),s(v)\) or neither, and contributes zero modulo two to \(\sum_v a_v\). If \(\alpha(uv)=1\), it is incident with precisely one reference endpoint and contributes one, independently of which lift is red. Summing over all base edges gives
\[
\sum_{v\in V(G)}a_v\equiv\sum_{e\in E(G)}\alpha(e)\pmod2.
\]
If \(m\) is odd, the coefficient \(m-1\) vanishes modulo two. If \(m\) is even, the all-edge set is Eulerian; the right-hand sum is the well-defined pairing of covering cohomology with the all-edge cycle, proving (22). \(\square\)

**Corollary 18 (even contact-edge count for both canonical models).** For every antipodally odd \(n\)-cube edge coloring with \(n\ge3\), and for every ordinary reversal-odd boundary 3-tournament on \(n\ge4\) vertices,
\[
\boxed{|E(K_d)|\equiv0\pmod2.}
\tag{23}
\]

*Proof.* If the cube dimension \(n\) is odd, Theorem 17 applies immediately. If \(n\ge4\) is even, choose the sheet of the folded-cube covering whose first coordinate is zero. The voltage is one precisely on quotient edges of direction one; their number is \(2^{n-2}\), which is even. Thus the cohomology pairing in (22) vanishes.

For boundary tournaments the ordered-pair cover \(S(K_n)\to L(K_n)\) has degree \(m=2(n-2)\), and its covering class is the canonical contact-curvature class \(\kappa_{K_n}\), established in the monodromy-tower Subsection. Orient \(K_n\) transitively with vertices \(0,1,\ldots,n-1\). At vertex \(v\) there are \(v\) incoming and \(n-1-v\) outgoing edges, and curvature one occurs on pairs with the same incidence sense. Summing the curvature over all edges of \(L(K_n)\) therefore gives
\[
\sum_{v=0}^{n-1}\left[
\binom v2+\binom{n-1-v}2
\right]
=2\binom n3\equiv0\pmod2.
\]
Apply Theorem 17. \(\square\)

Theorems 15 and 17 identify a pair of common matroidal constraints: the entire positive-turn edge multiset is an Eulerian cycle in the graphic matroid of the contact graph, and it has even cardinality. Equivalently, its evaluation under the constant-one edge functional is zero. These conditions survive arbitrary deck-odd recoloring in both canonical systems. They do not force a length-\(n\) lift of a port-parallel loop; that additional metric selection is the remaining obstruction to NORI1.
