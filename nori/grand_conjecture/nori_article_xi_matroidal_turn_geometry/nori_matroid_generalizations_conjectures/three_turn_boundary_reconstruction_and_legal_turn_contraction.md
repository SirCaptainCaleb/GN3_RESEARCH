# Three-turn boundary reconstruction and legal-turn contraction

Let \(n\ge5\). Write \(S_n\) for the ordered-pair double cover of \(L(K_n)\), with vertices \((u,v)\) and undirected edges labelled by triples \(t=(a,b,c)\), corresponding to \((a,b)-(b,c)\), where the three symbols are distinct. Its deck involution reverses ordered pairs and triple labels. Put
\[
H_{\rm full}=L(S_n)/\langle\rho\rangle\cong L^2(K_n).
\]
The covering \(L(S_n)\to H_{\rm full}\) defines the pointed binary dual \(D_{\rm full}\) of the incidence-plus-monodromy matrix of Article XI.

Declare a turn between triple states **legal** if it has a lift of the form
\[
(a,b,c)\;--\;(b,c,d),\qquad
a,b,c,d\text{ pairwise distinct},
\tag{1}
\]
or the reverse traversal. Let \(F\subseteq E(H_{\rm full})\) be its set of legal turns and \(H_{\rm leg}=(V(H_{\rm full}),F)\). This is the quotient of the alternating-port ordered-triple overlap graph from Article XI. Let \(T=E(H_{\rm full})\setminus F\).

**Theorem 1 (three-turn reconstruction).** Every omitted turn \(e\in T\) has a lifted representative joining two triple states \(t,t'\) that can be joined by a legal-turn path of length at most three in the ordered-triple graph. The projected path \(P_e\subseteq F\) can be chosen such that \(P_e\cup\{e\}\) is a simple cycle of \(H_{\rm full}\) with trivial covering monodromy. In particular,
\[
\boxed{\forall X\in Z(D_{\rm full}),\quad
\mathbf1_X(e)=\sum_{f\in P_e}\mathbf1_X(f)\pmod2,\qquad |P_e|\le3.}
\tag{2}
\]
Equivalently, every \(e\in T\) belongs to a cocircuit \(Y_e\) of \(D_{\rm full}\) avoiding the port and satisfying
\[
\boxed{Y_e\cap T=\{e\},\qquad |Y_e|\le4.}\tag{3}
\]
The bound three in (2) is attained by the forbidden return turns.

*Proof.* Fix the ordered-pair state \((u,v)\) at which the lifted omitted turn meets. Its incident triple states are of two types,
\[
I_w=(w,u,v),\qquad O_z=(u,v,z),
\quad w,z\notin\{u,v\}.
\]
The legal turns at this state are \(I_w--O_z\) with \(w\ne z\). Every omitted turn falls into one of the following cases.

If \(e=I_wI_{w'}\), with \(w\ne w'\), choose \(z\notin\{u,v,w,w'\}\). Then
\(I_w--O_z--I_{w'}\) is a legal two-turn path.

If \(e=O_zO_{z'}\), choose \(w\notin\{u,v,z,z'\}\). Then
\(O_z--I_w--O_{z'}\) is a legal two-turn path.

If \(e=I_wO_w\), choose distinct \(x,y\notin\{u,v,w\}\). Then
\[
I_w--O_x--I_y--O_w
\tag{4}
\]
is a legal three-turn path. These choices exist for \(n\ge5\). In each case the displayed triple states belong to different reversal orbits, so their projections together with \(e\) form a simple cycle. The lifted path followed by the reversed omitted turn closes on the original sheet, hence that cycle has monodromy zero. Its edge set is therefore a non-port circuit of the incidence-plus-monodromy matroid, equivalently a non-port cocircuit of \(D_{\rm full}\). Binary cycle–cocircuit orthogonality yields (2) and (3). \(\square\)
