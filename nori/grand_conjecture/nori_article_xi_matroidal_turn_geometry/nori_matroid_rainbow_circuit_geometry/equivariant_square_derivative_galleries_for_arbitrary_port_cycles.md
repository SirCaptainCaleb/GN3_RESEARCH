# Equivariant square-derivative galleries for arbitrary port cycles

Let \(n\ge3\), let \(H_n=L(Q_n)/\langle\tau\rangle\), and let \((D_n,p)\) be the pointed binary matroid defined by the antipodal turn cover. Fix any binary cycle \(X\in Z(D_n)\) containing the port \(p\), and write \(d_X\) for its indicator on turns. At a cube vertex \(x\), write \(d^X_{ij}([x])\) for the label of the turn between the edges in directions \(i,j\). For \(i\ne j\), define the square derivative
\[
\partial_j^X(i;x)=d^X_{ij}([x])+d^X_{ij}([x^j])\in\mathbb F_2.
\tag{1}
\]
The star-triangle and square identities for a port cycle make (1) a function of its undirected \((i,j)\)-square, constant on antipodal square pairs. If \(c\) is either reconstructed antipodally odd cube-edge coloring, then
\[
\partial_j^X(i;x)=c_i(x)+c_i(x^j).
\tag{2}
\]
Thus all derivative conditions below are intrinsically determined by \(X\).

Let \(\mathcal T_n\) be the antipodally invariant Freudenthal triangulation of the boundary of the \(n\)-cube. Its maximal simplices are monotone vertex chains through an \((n-1)\)-dimensional coordinate facet, corresponding to geodesics traversing all directions but the fixed one. Write \(\tau\) for complementation of cube vertices.

Fix a family
\[
\mathcal A=((i_\alpha,S_\alpha))_{\alpha=1}^r,
\qquad i_\alpha\in[n],\quad
S_\alpha\subseteq[n]\setminus\{i_\alpha\},\quad
|S_\alpha|\equiv0\pmod2,
\tag{3}
\]
where directions may repeat. Call a maximal simplex of \(\mathcal T_n\) a witness for \(\mathcal A\) if its facet geodesic contains, for each \(\alpha\), a step in some direction \(j\ne i_\alpha\) crossing an \((i_\alpha,j)\)-square with
\[
\partial_j^X(i_\alpha;x)\ne\mathbf1_{\{j\in S_\alpha\}}.
\tag{4}
\]
Let \(\mathcal G_{\mathcal A}(X)\) be the adjacency graph of witnessing maximal simplices, joined when they share a codimension-one simplex. Its vertices and adjacency depend only on \(X\) and the indexed constraints.

**Theorem (simultaneous port-derivative witnesses and invariant galleries).** For every \(X\) and every family (3):

(i) If \(r\le n-1\), the graph \(\mathcal G_{\mathcal A}(X)\) is nonempty.

(ii) If \(r\le n-2\), the graph contains a connected component invariant under \(\tau\).

The bound \(r\le n-2\) for invariant connectedness is sharp in every dimension.

*Proof.* Recover a cube-edge coloring \(c\) from \(X\) and define at every vertex \(x\)
\[
g_\alpha(x)=(-1)^{\,c_{i_\alpha}(x)+\sum_{j\in S_\alpha}x_j}.
\tag{5}
\]
Every \(|S_\alpha|\) is even, and \(c_{i_\alpha}\) is antipodally odd, so \(g_\alpha(\bar x)=-g_\alpha(x)\). Changing the reconstructed coloring by complementation changes all \(g_\alpha\) by a global sign; their zero sets and sign-mixed simplices are unaffected. Moreover \(g_\alpha(x^{i_\alpha})=g_\alpha(x)\), and on a direction-\(j\) edge the sign changes precisely when (4) holds, by (2).

Extend the sign vector \(g=(g_1,\ldots,g_r)\) affinely on every simplex of \(\mathcal T_n\). This produces an odd continuous piecewise-linear map
\[
G:|\mathcal T_n|\cong S^{n-1}\longrightarrow\mathbb R^r.
\tag{6}
\]
If \(r\le n-1\), the Borsuk–Ulam theorem gives a zero of \(G\). The smallest simplex containing that zero has both signs in each coordinate, because zero is a convex combination of its vertex sign vectors. Its containing maximal simplex is therefore a witness for every constraint: along its vertex chain the sign of each \(g_\alpha\) changes on some edge, and such a step has direction different from \(i_\alpha\). This proves (i).

For (ii), we first prove a connected-zero-set principle. If \(F:S^d\to\mathbb R^r\) is an odd piecewise-linear map with \(r\le d-1\), some connected component of \(F^{-1}(0)\) is invariant under the antipodal map. Indeed, its zero set is a finite polyhedron, hence has finitely many connected components. If every component were exchanged with another, assign signs \(+1,-1\) to the paired components, obtaining an odd continuous function \(h:F^{-1}(0)\to\{-1,1\}\). Extend \(h\) continuously to the sphere and antisymmetrize its extension to get an odd function \(H\) that remains \(h\) on the zero set. The odd map \((F,H):S^d\to\mathbb R^{r+1}\) would be nowhere zero, contradicting Borsuk–Ulam because \(r+1\le d\).

Apply this principle to (6), with \(d=n-1\). Let \(Z_0\subseteq G^{-1}(0)\) be a connected \(\tau\)-invariant component. Every maximal simplex meeting \(Z_0\) is a witness, as above. The finite family of their closed intersections with \(Z_0\) covers \(Z_0\) and has connected intersection graph. When two maximal simplices share a zero \(z\), both contain the smallest simplex \(\rho\) containing \(z\). The maximal simplices containing \(\rho\) form a ridge-connected gallery in the triangulated sphere. Every intermediate ridge contains \(\rho\) and hence has both signs in each coordinate; all adjacent maximal simplices are witnesses. Thus all maximal simplices meeting \(Z_0\) belong to one connected component of \(\mathcal G_{\mathcal A}(X)\). Since this collection is invariant under \(\tau\), that component is invariant.

For sharpness, define the antipodally odd edge coloring
\[
c_i(x)=x_{i+1}\quad(i<n),\qquad c_n(x)=x_1.
\tag{7}
\]
Choose \(r=n-1\), with \((i_\alpha,S_\alpha)=(\alpha,\varnothing)\) for \(1\le\alpha<n\). Each constraint is met only by crossing direction \(i_\alpha+1\), so a witnessing facet chain must traverse all directions \(2,\ldots,n\). It therefore lies in one of the two opposite facets \(x_1=0\) or \(x_1=1\). These families have no adjacent maximal simplices, and \(\tau\) exchanges them. The coloring corresponds to a port cycle \(X\), so the threshold is sharp within the pointed-matroid class. \(\square\)

**Corollary (connected derivative-defect galleries under a large port intersection).** Suppose \(n\ge5\) is odd, \(I(X)\ge6\), and \(I\subseteq[n]\) is nonempty with \(|I|\le n-2\). There is a connected \(\tau\)-invariant gallery of facet-spanning geodesics such that for every path in the gallery, and every \(i\in I\), some step in direction \(j\ne i\) crosses a square with
\[
\partial_j^X(i;x)=0
\tag{8}
\]
whose projected corner lies in the terminal-hole set \(\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)\) defined by the codimension-two face-terminal condition.

*Proof.* For each \(i\in I\), use the mask \(S_i=[n]\setminus\{i\}\), whose size \(n-1\) is even. Equation (4) then becomes (8), and the theorem gives the invariant connected gallery. The terminal-hole inclusion for a port cycle with \(I(X)\ge6\) states that a square with derivative zero cannot project to a terminal of a face-spanning path with at most two changes: such a terminal would force both square derivatives to be one. Therefore each square in (8) projects into \(\mathfrak H_{ij}(X)\). \(\square\)

**Corollary (simultaneous opposite derivative values).** If \(n\ge5\) is odd and \(I\subseteq[n]\) satisfies \(2|I|\le n-2\), there is a connected, antipodally invariant gallery of facet-spanning geodesics such that every path in the gallery crosses, for every \(i\in I\), one square with \(\partial_j^X(i)=0\) and another (possibly involving a different direction) with \(\partial_k^X(i)=1\).

*Proof.* For each \(i\in I\), impose both masks \(S=\varnothing\) and \(S=[n]\setminus\{i\}\). They are even, and their requirements (4) force the derivative values one and zero, respectively. Apply the theorem with \(r=2|I|\). \(\square\)

These assertions give a dimension-independent, equivariant connectivity constraint on every port cycle, in addition to the numerical intersection and defect bounds. The gallery witnesses local square derivatives and retains the full facet-path flags. The existence of a minimum port cocircuit with small intersection remains an additional global extraction problem.
