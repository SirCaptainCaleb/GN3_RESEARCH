# A monochromatic facet lifts to a full one-change geodesic

# Facet monochromatic lifting and a face-dependent tournament-factorized class

**Lemma (monochromatic facet lifting).** Let \(n\ge4\), \(g\in[n]\), and let \(c\) be any binary coloring of ordered three-faces of \(Q_n\), without a symmetry assumption. If one facet \(H=\{x:x_g=\varepsilon\}\cong Q_{n-1}\) contains a full \((n-1)\)-direction geodesic all of whose ordered-three-face windows have the same color, then the full \(Q_n\) has an antipodal geodesic with at most one color change.

**Proof.** Let \(p=(p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1})\) be the direction order of the monochromatic geodesic in \(H\), starting from \(y\in H\). In \(Q_n\), start at the vertex whose \(g\)-bit is \(1-\varepsilon\) and whose other coordinates agree with \(y\), and traverse directions \((g,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1})\). Its first ordered-three-face window contains \(g\) and has arbitrary color \(b\); after the first move the path is in \(H\), and its remaining \(n-3\) windows agree exactly with those of the given monochromatic path in \(H\), so each has color \(q\). The full word is \(b,q,\ldots,q\), with at most one change. \(\square\)

**Corollary (one-facet tournament factorization).** Fix \(g\) and one facet \(x_g=\varepsilon\). Suppose that on all ordered three-faces lying entirely within this single facet, the coloring is position-independent and is of the form
\[
c(F,(a,b,d))=t(a,d)\oplus s(b),
\]
where \(t(a,d)=0\) for \(a\to d\) in some tournament on \([n]\setminus\{g\}\), \(t(d,a)=1\oplus t(a,d)\), and \(s\) is constant except possibly at one direction. Then \(Q_n\) admits a one-change antipodal geodesic. The coloring of every face containing \(g\), and every face in the opposite facet, is arbitrary; antipodal-reversal oddness is unnecessary.

**Proof.** The balanced two-path tournament lemma of Item nori_tournament_two_path_monochromatic_20261008 supplies a monochromatic full geodesic in the specified \((n-1)\)-facet. Apply the lemma above. \(\square\)

**Research role.** A single suitably structured facet suffices for full one-change closure. In particular, face-dependent behavior outside that facet and across the entering ordered-three-face window cannot spoil the construction. This is a route for extending monochromatic coordinate-only theorems to genuine face-dependent NORI families.
