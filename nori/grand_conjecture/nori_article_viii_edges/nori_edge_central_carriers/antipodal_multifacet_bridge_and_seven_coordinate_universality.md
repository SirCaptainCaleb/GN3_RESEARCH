# Antipodal multifacet bridge and seven-coordinate universality

# Antipodal multifacet bridging: an exact localization theorem for unrestricted NORI1

## Statement and historical context

Let \(k\ge2\). Define \(B_k\) to be the **Leader–Long/Feder–Subi geodesic one-switch assertion in dimension \(k\)**:

> Every arbitrary binary coloring \(d\) of the *undirected physical edges* of \(Q_k\) admits a **full antipodal geodesic** whose edge-color sequence changes at most once.

Unlike NORI1, \(d\) need not satisfy any antipodal relation. For integers \(n>k\), and a fixed \(k\)-set \(S\subseteq[n]\), define \(P_{n,S}\) to be the **full geodesic partial-color prescription assertion**:

> For every antipodally odd coloring \(c\) of the genuine undirected physical edges of \(Q_n\), and every target \(t\in\mathbb F_2^S\), there exist a physical root \(x\) and a permutation \(p\) of **all \(n\) directions** such that the full antipodal geodesic \(P(x,p)\) traverses its unique edge in each direction \(i\in S\) with color exactly \(t_i\). The colors in the other \(n-k\) directions are unrestricted.

This is an exact property of all legal NORI1 colorings, not a condition on affine or direction-only subclasses.

**Theorem 1 (multifacet bridge equivalence).** For every \(k\ge2\), every \(n>k\), and every fixed \(k\)-set \(S\subseteq[n]\),
\[
\boxed{\quad B_k\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad P_{n,S}.\quad}
\tag{1}
\]
In particular, the property that *every* legal antipodally odd physical-edge coloring in *any one larger dimension* realizes all prescribed colors on *one specified set of \(k\) directions* is equivalent to the arbitrary-color \(k\)-cube one-switch geodesic assertion.

The implication \(B_k\Rightarrow P_{n,S}\) uses **all** \(n-k\) exterior directions as a single antipodal bridge between opposite physical \(k\)-faces; no colors along the bridge need to be specified.

## Proof of the forward implication

Assume \(B_k\). Fix \(n>k\), \(S\), a legal physical antipodally odd edge coloring \(c\) of \(Q_n\), and an arbitrary target \(t=(t_i)_{i\in S}\).

Identify \(Q_n=Q_S\times Q_D\) with \(D=[n]\setminus S\ne\varnothing\); write a cube vertex as \((u,z)\). Fix an **arbitrary** exterior vertex \(z\in Q_D\). On the *lower physical \(S\)-face* \(Q_S\times\{z\}\), define an arbitrary undirected-edge coloring
\[
d_i(u):=c_i(u,z)\oplus t_i,\qquad i\in S.
\tag{2}
\]
This is a legal physical \(k\)-cube edge coloring because \(c_i(u,z)=c_i(u\oplus e_i,z)\); **no** antipodal oddness is assumed for \(d\).

By \(B_k\), there exists a full antipodal geodesic \(R\) of \(Q_S\) whose \(d\)-color word has at most one change. Reverse its traversal if needed so its word is \(0^a1^{k-a}\), with \(0\le a\le k\). Write
\[
R:\ u_0\xrightarrow{U}u_a\xrightarrow{V}\bar u_0
\tag{3}
\]
where \(U\) and \(V\) denote ordered, disjoint lists of \(S\)-directions whose union is \(S\), with all edges of \(U\) having \(d\)-color 0 and all edges of \(V\) having \(d\)-color 1. Empty \(U\) and \(V\) are permitted.

Now construct a **genuine full \(n\)-direction cube geodesic**, starting at \((u_a,z)\):

1. Traverse the \(U\)-edges in reverse order inside the lower physical facet, moving \((u_a,z)\to(u_0,z)\).
2. Traverse *every* direction of \(D\) exactly once, in any order, moving \((u_0,z)\to(u_0,\bar z)\).
3. Follow the **reverse of the \(Q_S\)-antipodal image of the \(V\)-suffix** from (3), inside the upper physical facet, moving \((u_0,\bar z)\to(\bar u_a,\bar z)\).

All \(n\) directions are used exactly once, so the constructed path is a genuine full antipodal geodesic. On its \(U\)-edges, the lower-facet formula (2) and the undirected reversal of the 0-block give actual \(c\)-color \(t_i\). On its \(V\)-edges, each upper-facet edge is the **global cube antipode** of the corresponding lower-facet physical edge of \(R\) (after projecting the \(Q_S\)-antipodal reversal); its actual \(c\)-color is therefore the complement of the original lower color \(d_i\oplus t_i=1\oplus t_i\), namely \(t_i\). The intervening \(D\)-edges have arbitrary colors, which do not affect the required prescription. Thus \(P_{n,S}\) holds. \(\square\)

## Proof of the reverse implication

Assume \(P_{n,S}\). Let \(d\) be **any** arbitrary binary coloring of the undirected edges of \(Q_k\). Pick a distinguished exterior direction \(s\in D=[n]\setminus S\). Define a physical edge coloring \(c\) of \(Q_n\) using \(d\), with \(u\in Q_S\), \(z\in Q_D\), and one distinguished original coordinate \(i_0\in S\):

\[
c_i(u,z)=
\begin{cases}
d_i(u),&z_s=0,\\
1\oplus d_i(\bar u),&z_s=1,
\end{cases}
\qquad(i\in S),\tag{4}
\]
\[
c_j(u,z)=u_{i_0}\quad(j\in D).\tag{5}
\]
The main \(S\)-edge colors are physical because \(d_i\) is invariant under flipping its free \(i\)-bit; the exterior \(j\)-edge color in (5) is independent of its free \(j\)-bit. Antipodality of the *full* \(Q_n\) interchanges the two \(s\)-facets and complements the main colors in (4). It also complements \(u_{i_0}\), verifying \(c_j(\bar u,\bar z)=1\oplus c_j(u,z)\) for each \(j\in D\). Thus \(c\) is a legitimate antipodally odd physical-edge coloring of \(Q_n\). The colors in (4) depend on exterior coordinates **only through \(z_s\)**.

By \(P_{n,S}\), choose a full antipodal cube geodesic whose edge color is 0 in every direction of \(S\). Reverse its traversal if needed so that the unique \(s\)-step crosses from \(z_s=0\) to \(z_s=1\). Let \(U\) be its ordered \(S\)-direction list before the \(s\)-step, and \(V\) its ordered \(S\)-direction list after the \(s\)-step. Ignore moves in the other exterior directions. The projected \(S\)-word is \(U,V\), a permutation of all \(k\) directions. It begins at some \(u_0\), reaches some \(u_a\) after \(U\), and ends at \(\bar u_0\) after \(V\).

On the \(U\) edges, (4) says precisely \(d\)-color 0. On the \(V\) edges, (4) says precisely that the **\(Q_S\)-antipodal image of the projected \(V\)-suffix** carries \(d\)-color 1. Therefore the projected \(Q_S\) path obtained by reversing \(U\), and then following the reverse \(Q_S\)-antipodal image of \(V\),
\[
u_a\xrightarrow{U^{\mathrm{rev}}}u_0
\xrightarrow{\overline{V}^{\,\mathrm{rev}}}\bar u_a,
\tag{6}
\]
uses every \(S\) direction exactly once and changes \(d\)-color **at most once**: the first block has color 0 and the second block color 1. (When one block is empty, it is monochromatic.) This is a genuine full antipodal \(Q_k\)-geodesic. It proves \(B_k\). \(\square\)

**Additional switch-count transfer.** The forward proof works without assuming the \(d\)-geodesic has only one change. Given an arbitrary \(d\)-antipodal geodesic with \(r\ge1\) switches, choose the \(U|V\) split at **any one of its color changes**. Reversing the first block preserves its internal switch count; antipodally reversing and complementing the second block preserves its internal switch count; the chosen seam changes from a switch to a match. Hence the selected-direction color word on the resulting \(Q_n\) full geodesic, compared with any prescribed directionwise target \(t\), has exactly **\(r-1\)** switches. For \(r=0\), place all \(S\)-directions on one side of the exterior bridge; the selected word remains constant. Thus any upper bound on switches in arbitrary \(k\)-cube colorings transfers to a one-smaller bound for the **selected** direction word of every larger NORI1 coloring (not to the full \(n\)-edge color word, whose exterior bridge colors are uncontrolled).

## Consequence: universal seven-direction color prescription

**Corollary 2 (all \(n\): every seven selected colors are realizable).** For every dimension \(n\ge8\), every legal antipodally odd physical-edge coloring of \(Q_n\), every set \(S\subseteq[n]\) of size \(k\le7\), and every prescribed color vector \(t\in\mathbb F_2^S\), there exists a genuine **full \(n\)-edge antipodal geodesic** whose \(k\) selected edges have **exactly** the specified colors.

**Proof.** The geodesic Norine conjecture \(A_m\) has been established for **every \(m\le8\)**, including the SAT-certified case \(m=8\) in Kirchweger–Peitl–Subercaseaux–Szeider (2025), *From the Finite to the Infinite: Sharper Asymptotic Bounds on Norin's Conjecture via SAT*, arXiv:2511.08386, Theorem 1 (the paper explicitly states the *geodesic* conjecture in dimension eight). Leader and Long (2014), *Long geodesics in subgraphs of the cube*, Proposition 3.6 in arXiv:1301.2195v1, proved \(A_{k+1}\Rightarrow B_k\). Thus \(B_k\) holds for \(k\le7\). Theorem 1 above then gives \(P_{n,S}\) for every \(n>k\), as required. \(\square\)

For \(n\le8\), the stronger statement that **all \(n\) prescribed direction colors** can be realized also follows directly from the established full-geodesic result \(A_n\): independently XOR the desired \(t_i\) into each direction's edge color, preserving physicality and oddness, then use \(A_n\). Consequently, for **every** \(n\ge2\), arbitrary prescribed colors on any set of size \(\min(n,7)\) are simultaneously attainable, and in dimensions at most eight all \(n\) colors are attainable.

**Boundary of the result.** This uses a previously proved finite-dimensional geodesic theorem and an exact new dimension-free bridge implication. It is not a proof of the full NORI1 conjecture in arbitrary dimension; for eight selected directions in \(n\ge9\), the bridge equivalence reduces the question **exactly** to \(B_8\), equivalently to the known Leader–Long dimensional challenge \(A_9\Rightarrow B_8\) in one direction. The argument makes no claim about *ordinary boundary 3-tournaments*: it uses an edge (one-window) color seam, whereas ordered-three-face paths acquire two extra seam windows.
