# Full-geodesic color profiles span the entire binary space

# The full-geodesic color-profile span theorem for unrestricted NORI1

Let \(n\ge2\) and let \(c_i(u)\in\mathbb F_2\) be the color of the **physical undirected** edge \(\{u,u\oplus e_i\}\) of the Boolean cube \(Q_n\). Assume the exact NORI1 conditions
\[
c_i(u\oplus e_i)=c_i(u),\qquad
c_i(\bar u)=1\oplus c_i(u)
\tag{1}
\]
for every direction \(i\) and cube vertex \(u\). No linearity, locality, exterior-support, regularity, or direction-independence is assumed.

For a starting root \(u\in Q_n\) and a permutation \(p\) of all \(n\) coordinates, traverse the genuine full antipodal geodesic in the order \(p\). Record its edge-color vector **indexed by original coordinate direction**, independently of the order in which those directions were used:
\[
w_i(u,p)=c_i\bigl(u\oplus\{p_j:j<p^{-1}(i)\}\bigr)
\quad(i=1,\ldots,n).
\tag{2}
\]
Write \(\mathcal W(c)=\{w(u,p):u\in Q_n,\ p\in S_n\}\subseteq\mathbb F_2^n\).

**Theorem (unrestricted full-profile affine span).**
\[
\boxed{\operatorname{aff}_{\mathbb F_2}\mathcal W(c)=\mathbb F_2^n.}
\tag{3}
\]
Equivalently, for every **nonempty set of directions** \(S\subseteq[n]\), the parity
\[
\bigoplus_{i\in S} w_i(u,p)
\]
assumes **both** binary values among genuine full antipodal cube geodesics. Thus the attainable full-profile family obeys *no nontrivial universal affine parity identity* for any legal NORI1 coloring, even when the coloring is nonlinear.

**Proof.** Suppose (3) fails. Linear algebra over \(\mathbb F_2\) supplies a nonzero vector \(y=(y_i)\in\mathbb F_2^n\) and a constant \(\kappa\) such that
\[
\bigoplus_i y_iw_i(u,p)=\kappa
\tag{4}
\]
for **every** root \(u\) and full coordinate permutation \(p\).

Give each physical edge in direction \(i\) the mod-two weight
\[
\omega_i(u)=y_i c_i(u).
\tag{5}
\]
Because \(c_i\) is an undirected physical-edge color, \(\omega_i(u\oplus e_i)=\omega_i(u)\).

Fix any physical square with corner \(u\) and distinct directions \(i,j\). Compare two full antipodal geodesics *from the same root* \(u\): the first starts with directions \((i,j)\), the second with \((j,i)\), and both use **the same order of all remaining directions**. They reach the same vertex after two moves, so every later physical edge is identical. Subtracting the two instances of (4) therefore gives the exact square-closedness equation
\[
\omega_i(u)\oplus\omega_j(u\oplus e_i)
\oplus\omega_j(u)\oplus\omega_i(u\oplus e_j)=0.
\tag{6}
\]
Every square is realized by such a pair of genuine full geodesics; no based-window or abstract-face identification has been used.

Since every square has zero mod-two curvature, the edge cochain \(\omega\) is a gradient on the Boolean cube:
\[
\omega_i(u)=\phi(u)\oplus\phi(u\oplus e_i)
\tag{7}
\]
for some vertex potential \(\phi:Q_n\to\mathbb F_2\). For completeness, fix \(\phi(0)=0\), and define \(\phi(u)\) by integrating \(\omega\) along any cube path from \(0\) to \(u\). Any two such paths differ by backtrack cancellations and elementary square swaps; physical edge invariance and (6) make their integrals equal. Thus (7) follows.

Every full antipodal geodesic telescopes under (7), so (4) implies
\[
\psi(u):=\phi(u)\oplus\phi(\bar u)=\kappa
\quad\text{for every }u.
\tag{8}
\]
But for every coordinate \(i\), the edge-gradient identity and **antipodal oddness** in (1) give
\[
\begin{aligned}
\psi(u\oplus e_i)\oplus\psi(u)
 &=\omega_i(u)\oplus\omega_i(\bar u)\\
 &= y_i\bigl(c_i(u)\oplus c_i(\bar u)\bigr)\\
 &=y_i.
\end{aligned}
\tag{9}
\]
Because \(\psi\) is constant, the left side is zero, forcing \(y_i=0\) for every \(i\), contrary to \(y\ne0\). This proves (3). \(\square\)

**Corollary (arbitrary prescribed colors on two directions).** Fix any **two distinct coordinate directions** \(i,j\) and any pair \((a,b)\in\mathbb F_2^2\). There exists a genuine *full antipodal cube geodesic*, with some starting root and permutation of **all \(n\) directions**, whose edge in direction \(i\) has color \(a\) and whose edge in direction \(j\) has color \(b\).

**Proof.** Projection of (3) onto the \(i,j\) coordinates implies that the attainable pair-profile set has full affine span \(\mathbb F_2^2\). From (1), changing the root from \(u\) to \(\bar u\) while keeping the same direction order replaces every color \(w_i(u,p)\) by its complement. Hence the pair-profile set is closed under
\[
(a,b)\longmapsto(1\oplus a,1\oplus b).
\]
The only complement-invariant subset of \(\mathbb F_2^2\) with full affine span is the entire four-element set. \(\square\)

**Quantitative and constructive formulation.** Every legal coloring has at least \(n+1\) affinely independent realized direction-indexed full-geodesic profiles. For any prescribed nonzero functional \(y\), witnesses of opposite \(y\)-parity can be constructed by one of two physically exact mechanisms:

* If the weighted cochain \(\omega_i=y_ic_i\) has nonzero curvature on some square, the two full orders beginning with that square's directions in opposite orders give opposite \(y\)-parities at the same root.
* If every square has zero curvature, construct the potential \(\phi\) in (7), choose any \(i\) with \(y_i=1\), and use two full paths with the same coordinate order and roots differing by \(e_i\). Equation (9) shows their \(y\)-parities are opposite.

Thus the result is not merely an existential use of linear algebra: the proof isolates an explicit **adjacent-swap versus single-root-flip dichotomy** for every nonzero parity functional.

**Mathematical significance and exact gap.** This theorem is a statement about **every** antipodally odd *physical-edge* NORI1 coloring. It establishes unrestricted two-direction prescription and excludes all affine-linear parity certificates for the nonattainment of full color words. These conclusions rely on global consistency of physical square edges and antipodal oddness, rather than on affine formulas for the edge colors. They sharpen the partial-geodesic and restricted affine-family perspectives by identifying a global algebraic universality property that holds in the entire still-open class.

Full affine **span** of \(\mathcal W(c)\) does not imply \(\mathcal W(c)=\mathbb F_2^n\), nor that either constant vector \(0^n\) or \(1^n\) is attained. Full monochromatic NORI1 remains open. The precise missing implication is an additional *joint higher-order compatibility theorem* raising these independent parity separations and two-coordinate prescriptions to an all-coordinate word realization (or merely a monochromatic full word). The theorem also makes no claim about unrestricted ordinary boundary 3-tournaments; there the colored objects are ordered triples, and the square-gradient identity of physical edges has no direct analogue.
